A 42-year-old Russian fisherman was being mauled by a brown bear when his Justin Bieber “Baby” ringtone saved his life, he believes.

The Daily Mail reports that Igor Vorozhbitsyn had parked his car and was walking towards his favorite fishing spot when the bear attacked him and began clawing his face and chest, but then his phone rang, playing the annoying crescendo of “baby, baby, baby, baby oooh,” and the bear did what any creature with ears would do when it heard Justin Bieber: it fled.

“I couldn’t believe my luck when the phone went off and he fled,” he said.

The man, who sustained cuts and bruises on his face and chest and was taken to the hospital after other fisherman found him, said he firmly believes if his phone hadn’t rang he would have been killed, marking the first time in written history that someone has been thankful for Justin Bieber’s existence.
