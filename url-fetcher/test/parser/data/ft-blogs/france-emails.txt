Blimey, those lazy French slackers are at it again.

Not content with a statutory 35-hour week, now people are banned from checking work emails after 6pm. No wonder France’s economy is going down the pan. That, more or less, was the story that went viral this week after a flurry of reports on English-language media (The Guardian, the Daily Mail, the tech blog Engadget among others) that a new “legally binding labour agreement” in France prohibited employees from answering emails from work outside office hours.

It fitted nicely with a stereotype of France as a country where people habitually manage a bit of work between long holidays and are perpetually sitting in cafes sipping coffee or enjoying long lunches.

The story flew around the internet just as François Hollande was seeking to persuade the world that his reshuffled government, with a new hard-nosed, reformist prime minister in place, was serious about driving though pro-business, pro-growth policies.

But here, surely, was evidence of the reality confronting French employers?

Well, not quite. As a slew of indignant retorts on French media pointed out, the ever perfidious anglo-saxon media had take considerable liberties with the story.

The labour accord in question did, indeed, include a clause spelling out the “obligation” of workers concerned to disconnect their “remote communication tools” during their time off.

But it was a bit more complicated than that. The agreement was between two employers’ groups from the engineering, high tech and consultancy sectors and two unions representing mainly management-level workers. It applies to at most a few hundred thousand people.

It covers those who are paid on the basis of number of days worked, not the number of hours, who are specifically excluded from the 35-hour week. In fact, the accord spells out that they should not work more than a 13-hour day and should have a weekly break of not less than 35 hours, hardly a slackers’ schedule.

There is no mention of 6pm and no barrier to people taking work home. It was specifically designed to give flexibility to those working for foreign companies such as Google where contact is required with different time zones.

Many French employers – especially smaller companies – do find the 35-hour week irksome and they hate the huge weight of labour regulations and union agreements they must comply with. Mr Hollande is promising some relief in the latter, but not the former.

But French labour ministry statistics show that despite the statute, the average working week in France is 39.5 hours, not far behind the EU average of 40.3 hours. In the private sector, many companies have agreements in place – like the one highlighted this week – that in effect circumvent the 35-hour week.

Still, Paris is always unnaturally quiet on those Fridays that follow the seemingly numerous public holidays that fall on a Thursday. Not to mention the month of August, smartphone or no smartphone.
