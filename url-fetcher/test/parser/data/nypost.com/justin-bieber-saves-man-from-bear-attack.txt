Justin Bieber soothed the savage beast.

A fisherman in Russia narrowly avoided death by brown bear when his cellphone rang and the pop punk’s music sounded — sending the beast fleeing into the forest.

Igor Vorozhbitsyn was heading to a fishing spot in northern Russia when the bear suddenly appeared and pounced on him, Central European News reported.

“I had parked my car and was walking towards the spot I’d marked out when there was a tremendous impact on my back and the bear was on top of me,” Vorozhbitsyn said.

The 42-year-old was saved when Bieber’s chart-topping song “Baby” started playing.

“I couldn’t believe my luck when the phone went off and he fled,” Vorozhbitsyn said. “I know that sort of ringtone isn’t to everyone’s taste, but my granddaughter loaded it onto my phone for a joke.”

Vorozhbitsyn called for help after the bear took off and was rescued by other fishermen.

He suffered cuts and bruises around his face and chest and is currently recovering from the vicious attack. Vorozhbitsyn posted a picture of himself after the grisly attack — showing off his swollen eye, gauze wrapped around his head and bandages on his hand, arm and abdomen.

Bieber recently scuffled with “Lord of the Rings” actor Orlando Bloom after the insufferable teen heartthrob made snide comments about Miranda Kerr, Bloom’s ex-wife.

“Bieber said something rude to Orlando, like, ‘She was good,’ ” Page Six reported.
