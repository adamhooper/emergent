Let's face it: Apple's not so good at social. Path, the former "private" social network with not many users sucks at social too. Now, Apple is reportedly buying Path. It all makes so much sense.

The news comes via PandoDaily, which quotes an anonymous "single well-placed source inside Apple's engineering team" as saying: "It's almost done, if not signed already, but it's essentially a done deal."

Despite claims of a growing user base in recent months, Path, with its 25 million users, still lags far behind giants like Whatsapp, Facebook and Twitter. The company has been hemorrhaging employees and making desperate attempts to bounce back by releasing apps like Talk, a private messenger with bells and whistles, and a premium version with stickers and photo filters that no one really pays for.

Still, the app did gain critical acclaim for its beautiful user interface, so perhaps Apple could be its natural home. Cult of Mac points out that Path's ties to Apple go way back. Path CEO, Dave Morin, is a former employee, and during Tuesday's iPhone 6 keynote, he was spotted sitting up front, a place usually reserved for Apple executives.

According to PandoDaily, the app itself is likely to survive the acquisition by being incorporated into Apple's newly refreshed Messages app in iOS 8. How? Your guess is as good as ours. [PandoDaily via Cult of Mac]
