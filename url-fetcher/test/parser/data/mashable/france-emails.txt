Editors' note: The original version of this story stated that it was illegal for employees in France to answer work emails after 6 p.m. This was referring to an agreement that only affects a portion of employees within certain unions, not a countrywide ban or law. We have updated this article to reflect that.

Employers' federations and two unions in France signed a "new, legally binding" labor agreement on Thursday that encourages some staff to turn off their phones after 6 p.m., in an effort to curb burnout and promote a healthy work-life balance.

According to the deal, the employees covered under the agreement are not supposed to tend to their work-related emails on their computers or smartphones after the 6 p.m. deadline. The onus lies on employers to ensure that their employees don't feel the need to work after hours (or pressure them to do so).
