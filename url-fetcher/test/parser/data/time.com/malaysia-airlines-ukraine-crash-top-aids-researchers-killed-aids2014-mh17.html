<p>The researchers, health workers and activists were on their way to the International AIDS Conference in Melbourne. Among the victims planning to attend was Dutch national Joep Lange, a top AIDS researcher and former International AIDS Society president. Briton Glenn Thomas, a spokesperson for the World Health Organization and a former BBC journalist, was also on flight MH17.</p>
<p>The International AIDS Society expressed sadness over the news that its colleagues were on the Malaysian jetliner.</p>
<p>“At this incredibly sad and sensitive time the IAS stands with our international family and sends condolences to the loved ones of those who have been lost to this tragedy,” the group said in a statement.</p>
<p>Friends and colleagues of those within the AIDS-research community, including UNAIDS executive director Michel Sidibé, also expressed shock and grief over the tragic deaths on Twitter.</p>

<p>While the medical field mourns the lives of those killed, experts like Associate Professor Brian Owler, federal president of the Australian Medical Association, also fear that breakthroughs in HIV/AIDS research will now be stalled.</p>
<p>“The amount of knowledge that these people who died on the plane were carrying with them and the experiences they had developed will have a devastating impact on HIV research,” Owler told TIME.</p>
<p>&#8220;The amount of time it takes to get to a stage where you can come up with those ideas cannot be replaced in a short amount of time. So it does set back work for a cure and strategic prevention of HIV/AIDS very significantly,&#8221; he said.</p>

and ideas<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>After completing its first four cars, Local Motors, an automotive company based in Phoenix, threw a coming-out party at the annual Specialty Equipment Market Association (SEMA) trade show in Las Vegas. To Jay Rogers, the company\u2019s co-founder and CEO, it was a perfect combo. SEMA is the premier event for automotive specialty products makers, says Rogers, and Las Vegas gave his Rally Fighters\u2014low-slung beauties that look something like Ford Mustangs on steroids\u2014a chance to really strut their stuff.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cRally Fighters are designed for off-road racing as well as regular street driving,\u201d says Rogers, \u201cso where better to display them than in Las Vegas, where the streets stretch out to majestic desert sands?\u201d The city exudes \u201ca feeling of freedom, vitality and originality,\u201d he adds, the very things his customers prize.<\/p>\n<p>Rogers, a former Marine, a Harvard Business School graduate and grandson of the owner of the iconic Indian Motorcycle Co., has created a radically different kind of company that prefers open-source, bespoke manufacturing to the Henry Ford style of assembly line operations. Local Motors customers can customize their car any way they want, then visit the factory to help with the actual assembly.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe make it a delightful experience for them,\u201d explains Rogers, whose seven-year-old company has 59 employees who produce cars that go for up to $100,000 for an enthusiastic group of customers. \u201cThey get to know us and their cars in the process. It helps them value the investment.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Trade show organizers and participants have long voted Las Vegas as North America\u2019s top meeting and convention site. The city offers scale and cost-effective marketing, plus the crisp, clear weather that is ideal for taking car buffs out for test drives on the desert flats. \u201cWe\u2019ve invested a lot in Las Vegas because it\u2019s a great place for us to show our product and talk about our vision,\u201d Rogers says. \u201cIt\u2019s alive with possibilities.\u201d<\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-10451\"><\/div><\/aside>","hero":{"class":"landscape","thumbnail":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/02\/local-motors.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1","src":{"small":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/02\/local-motors.jpg?w=280","small_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/02\/local-motors.jpg?w=560","large":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/02\/local-motors.jpg?w=550","large_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/02\/local-motors.jpg?w=1100"},"credit":"Local Motors","caption":"","alt":""},"id":10451,"encoded_url":"http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2Fcontent-from%2Flvcva%2F10451%2Fhot-rods-in-vegas%2F","encoded_shortlink":"http%3A%2F%2Fti.me%2F1gH1iXh","encoded_title":"Hot+Rods+in+Vegas","twitter_text":"Hot%20Rods%20in%20Vegas","twitter_via":"TIME","sponsor":{"name":"LVCVA","slug":"lvcva","thumbnail":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/03\/lvcva-logo1.jpg?w=53","color":"#000000"},"email_title":"Hot%20Rods%20in%20Vegas%20%7C%20TIME","email_body":"Hot%20Rods%20in%20Vegas%0A%0A%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2Fcontent-from%2Flvcva%2F10451%2Fhot-rods-in-vegas%2F","omniture":{"modules":"rr-taboola-video|rr-ad"}},{"url":"http:\/\/time.com\/content-from\/lvcva\/11887\/vegas-eye-candy\/","shortlink":"http:\/\/ti.me\/1g5g3S2","title":"Vegas Eye Candy","post_type":"time_sponsored_post","short_title":"Vegas Eye Candy","time":{"pretty":"March 3, 2014","published":"2014-03-03 16:45:30","updated":"2014-03-03 21:45:30","minute":"4:45 pm","short":"3\/3"},"content":"<aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-taboola-video\" data-name=\"rr-taboola-video\"><div id=\"taboola-right-rail-organic-video-11887\" class=\"taboola\" data-mode=\"verticalx3\" data-placement=\"right-rail-organic\" data-type=\"video\"><\/div><\/aside><p><b>Las Vegas expos offer companies world-class showcases to exhibit their products<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Scala Inc. CEO Tom Nix has had a long-term love affair with Las Vegas, which is not surprising. Scala is a leader in digital signage and display software, and Las Vegas is arguably the digital signage capital of the world. \u201cThere\u2019s a wow factor when you walk down the street in Vegas,\u201d says Nix, \u201cand it\u2019s all about how people receive and interact with visual information.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>His company has a lot to do with making Las Vegas sparkle, and vice versa. The software maker counts on the city\u2019s trade shows and meetings to promote its wares and focus attention on digital media\u2019s vast and growing potential. Scala\u2019s huge exhibit at Las Vegas\u2019 annual Digital Signage Expo showcases cutting-edge communications for such varied industries as retail, transportation and hospitality.<\/p>\n<p>Nix also sees Las Vegas as the ideal place to get customers and colleagues thinking about digital communication solutions to the challenge of information overload. \u201cCasinos like Harrah\u2019s leverage their data to deliver a very personalized customer experience through membership clubs and customer relationship programs,\u201d he says.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s part of Scala\u2019s DNA\u2014personalizing data on a screen, whether for a shopper in a store or for people in a corporate environment. We can take existing data from a platform like Salesforce.com and display it with broadcast quality.\u201d That capability, Nix argues, enables companies to cut through the information clutter and keep employees focused on key performance goals in sales, customer relationship management, production or other areas.<\/p>\n<p>Scala software powers digital signs worldwide, but the company sees Las Vegas as a uniquely effective showplace because of its electric atmosphere. \u201cLas Vegas is great fun,\u201d Nix says, \u201cand that\u2019s significant. I can\u2019t tell you how many times I\u2019ve gone to Las Vegas expecting to meet with business acquaintances, only to leave there realizing that those people had become real friends.\u201d<\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-11887\"><\/div><\/aside>","hero":{"class":"landscape","thumbnail":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/03\/2011-vegasstrip-7-3102011-scala.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1","src":{"small":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/03\/2011-vegasstrip-7-3102011-scala.jpg?w=280","small_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/03\/2011-vegasstrip-7-3102011-scala.jpg?w=560","large":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/03\/2011-vegasstrip-7-3102011-scala.jpg?w=550","large_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/03\/2011-vegasstrip-7-3102011-scala.jpg?w=1100"},"credit":"StockPhotosforFree.com","caption":"","alt":""},"id":11887,"encoded_url":"http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2Fcontent-from%2Flvcva%2F11887%2Fvegas-eye-candy%2F","encoded_shortlink":"http%3A%2F%2Fti.me%2F1g5g3S2","encoded_title":"Vegas+Eye+Candy","twitter_text":"Vegas%20Eye%20Candy","twitter_via":"TIME","sponsor":{"name":"LVCVA","slug":"lvcva","thumbnail":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/03\/lvcva-logo1.jpg?w=53","color":"#000000"},"email_title":"Vegas%20Eye%20Candy%20%7C%20TIME","email_body":"Vegas%20Eye%20Candy%0A%0A%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2Fcontent-from%2Flvcva%2F11887%2Fvegas-eye-candy%2F","omniture":{"modules":"rr-taboola-video|rr-ad"}},{"url":"http:\/\/time.com\/content-from\/lvcva\/11888\/office-massage-comfort-in-vegas\/","shortlink":"http:\/\/ti.me\/1c2g5yf","title":"Office Massage &amp; Comfort in Vegas","post_type":"time_sponsored_post","short_title":"Office Massage &amp; Comfort in Vegas","time":{"pretty":"March 2, 2014","published":"2014-03-02 16:45:19","updated":"2014-03-02 21:45:19","minute":"4:45 pm","short":"3\/2"},"content":"<aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-taboola-video\" data-name=\"rr-taboola-video\"><div id=\"taboola-right-rail-organic-video-11888\" class=\"taboola\" data-mode=\"verticalx3\" data-placement=\"right-rail-organic\" data-type=\"video\"><\/div><\/aside><p><b><br \/>\nLas Vegas offers a great marketing platform for ErgoExpo, the ergonomics industry\u2019s major event<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Like all successful trade shows, ErgoExpo\u2014more formally, the National Ergonomics Conference and ErgoExpo\u2014is a galvanizing force for the industry it serves. Held each year at Las Vegas\u2019 Caesars Palace, it attracts 1,500 human resources executives, designers, health care providers and professional ergonomists, plus everyone from name-brand manufacturers like Microsoft and Steelcase to single-product startups.<\/p>\n<p>What gives the 19-year-old ErgoExpo its clout? First, it\u2019s where the action is. Ergonomics, the science of fitting workplace conditions and job demands to the capabilities of the working population, is top of mind everywhere. \u201cWe showcase the extraordinary research being done on every aspect of workplace injury and worker productivity,\u201d says Walter Charnizon, managing director of LRP Conferences, owners of ErgoExpo.<\/p>\n<p>Second, it provides incomparable networking opportunities. \u201cEach year, I meet exhibitors with small family businesses who tell me they get goose bumps from all the business opportunities they find,\u201d says Charnizon. ErgoExpo also gives manufacturers of all sizes a window on new marketing opportunities\u2014for instance, an FBI management and program analyst who came to a recent event seeking ergonomic advice on setting up and furnishing a new multimillion-dollar field office.<\/p>\n<p>All attendees come to ErgoExpo to inspect the latest in such ergonomically important areas, from adjustable keyboards to zero-gravity lifts. The point of the conference and expo, says Charnizon, is to highlight state-of-the-art ergonomics while making the industry more accessible and synergistic: \u201cWe bring together people tasked with adjusting to the changing nature of the workplace and the workforce.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Before moving ErgoExpo to Las Vegas 11 years ago, Charnizon\u2019s firm staged the meeting at three other venues, none of which proved nearly as effective. \u201cLas Vegas gets our business,\u201d Charnizon says. \u201cEvery aspect of the city is geared to the highest level of hospitality and accommodation. Las Vegas is focused on helping people like me do business, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s the conference and meeting center of the universe.\u201d<\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-11888\"><\/div><\/aside>","hero":{"class":"landscape","thumbnail":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/03\/pm_convention-center_s01a6894_1_3c-reduced.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1","src":{"small":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/03\/pm_convention-center_s01a6894_1_3c-reduced.jpg?w=280","small_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/03\/pm_convention-center_s01a6894_1_3c-reduced.jpg?w=560","large":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/03\/pm_convention-center_s01a6894_1_3c-reduced.jpg?w=550","large_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/03\/pm_convention-center_s01a6894_1_3c-reduced.jpg?w=1100"},"credit":"","caption":"","alt":""},"id":11888,"encoded_url":"http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2Fcontent-from%2Flvcva%2F11888%2Foffice-massage-comfort-in-vegas%2F","encoded_shortlink":"http%3A%2F%2Fti.me%2F1c2g5yf","encoded_title":"Office+Massage+%26+Comfort+in+Vegas","twitter_text":"Office%20Massage%20%26%20Comfort%20in%20Vegas","twitter_via":"TIME","sponsor":{"name":"LVCVA","slug":"lvcva","thumbnail":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/03\/lvcva-logo1.jpg?w=53","color":"#000000"},"email_title":"Office%20Massage%20%26%20Comfort%20in%20Vegas%20%7C%20TIME","email_body":"Office%20Massage%20%26%20Comfort%20in%20Vegas%0A%0A%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2Fcontent-from%2Flvcva%2F11888%2Foffice-massage-comfort-in-vegas%2F","omniture":{"modules":"rr-taboola-video|rr-ad"}},{"url":"http:\/\/time.com\/content-from\/lvcva\/11886\/the-biggest-spectacle-in-vegas-is-not-what-you-think\/","shortlink":"http:\/\/ti.me\/1pWDYLo","title":"The Biggest Spectacle In Vegas Is Not What You Think","post_type":"time_sponsored_post","short_title":"The Biggest Spectacle In Vegas Is Not What You Think","time":{"pretty":"March 1, 2014","published":"2014-03-01 16:45:09","updated":"2014-03-01 21:45:09","minute":"4:45 pm","short":"3\/1"},"content":"<aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-taboola-video\" data-name=\"rr-taboola-video\"><div id=\"taboola-right-rail-organic-video-11886\" class=\"taboola\" data-mode=\"verticalx3\" data-placement=\"right-rail-organic\" data-type=\"video\"><\/div><\/aside><p><b><br \/>\nLas Vegas is the best place in America for showcasing products and ideas<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Sony Electronics is more than a familiar consumer brand; it\u2019s one of the most innovative names in consumer and professional electronics. Moviemakers and TV studios, for example, use Sony gear to capture and edit content. The company\u2019s professional division also makes digital signage, security systems and an array of other ultrasophisticated electronics. Sony\u2019s advertising sums up the overriding philosophy: \u201cBelieve that anything you can imagine, you can make real.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Nowhere does that message resonate more clearly than at the eight to 10 spectacular trade show exhibitions that Sony mounts yearly in Las Vegas, North America\u2019s top trade show venue. \u201cThere\u2019s no better place on earth to showcase your wares,\u201d says John Kaloukian, Sony Electronics vice president of U.S. sales. \u201cLas Vegas has everything you need to make the right impression on your customers and then to entertain them royally.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Sony makes giant splashes at two premier Las Vegas events: the annual Consumer Electronics Show held each January, and the NAB (National Association of Broadcasters) Show in April. Sony\u2019s massive (up to 26,000 square feet) booths at the two events are typically double the size of the shows\u2019 next-largest installations. At a recent NAB Show, Sony\u2019s booth featured a 53-foot production trailer\u2014the kind you see parked outside major sports events. Guests strolled through the truck\u2019s interior, inspecting each cutting-edge piece of equipment.<\/p>\n<p>The company also participates in several more specialized Las Vegas events, such as InfoComm and the Digital Signage Expo, aimed at specific segments of the commercial electronics market. \u201cOur first goal,\u201d says Kaloukian, \u201cis to get customers to spend time with our engineers and sales and marketing team to get an overview of the products and solutions that Sony offers, along with some of our future technologies. Las Vegas is ideal for that. Not only are its convention facilities unsurpassed, but it\u2019s a place our customers really love visiting.\u201d<\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-11886\"><\/div><\/aside>","hero":{"class":"landscape","thumbnail":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/03\/sony_dsc08552-large.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1","src":{"small":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/03\/sony_dsc08552-large.jpg?w=280","small_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/03\/sony_dsc08552-large.jpg?w=560","large":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/03\/sony_dsc08552-large.jpg?w=550","large_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/03\/sony_dsc08552-large.jpg?w=1100"},"credit":"SONY","caption":"","alt":""},"id":11886,"encoded_url":"http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2Fcontent-from%2Flvcva%2F11886%2Fthe-biggest-spectacle-in-vegas-is-not-what-you-think%2F","encoded_shortlink":"http%3A%2F%2Fti.me%2F1pWDYLo","encoded_title":"The+Biggest+Spectacle+In+Vegas+Is+Not+What+You+Think","twitter_text":"The%20Biggest%20Spectacle%20In%20Vegas%20Is%20Not%20What%20You%20Think","twitter_via":"TIME","sponsor":{"name":"LVCVA","slug":"lvcva","thumbnail":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/03\/lvcva-logo1.jpg?w=53","color":"#000000"},"email_title":"The%20Biggest%20Spectacle%20In%20Vegas%20Is%20Not%20What%20You%20Think%20%7C%20TIME","email_body":"The%20Biggest%20Spectacle%20In%20Vegas%20Is%20Not%20What%20You%20Think%0A%0A%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2Fcontent-from%2Flvcva%2F11886%2Fthe-biggest-spectacle-in-vegas-is-not-what-you-think%2F","omniture":{"modules":"rr-taboola-video|rr-ad"}},{"url":"http:\/\/time.com\/content-from\/lvcva\/11772\/why-the-secret-to-success-is-located-in-the-heart-of-vegas\/","shortlink":"http:\/\/ti.me\/1fCPust","title":"Why The Secret To Success Is Located In The Heart Of Vegas","post_type":"time_sponsored_post","short_title":"Why The Secret To Success Is Located In The Heart Of Vegas","time":{"pretty":"Feb. 28, 2014","published":"2014-02-28 16:44:59","updated":"2014-02-28 21:44:59","minute":"4:44 pm","short":"2\/28"},"content":"<aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-taboola-video\" data-name=\"rr-taboola-video\"><div id=\"taboola-right-rail-organic-video-11772\" class=\"taboola\" data-mode=\"verticalx3\" data-placement=\"right-rail-organic\" data-type=\"video\"><\/div><\/aside><p><b><br \/>\nMeetings and conventions in Las Vegas give companies remarkable bang for their marketing bucks<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Cobra Electronics, a longtime leader in consumer communications gear, has a simple marketing secret: Instead of lavish consumer advertising, the Chicago-based company focuses on trade shows held in the place where important customers, bankers and other key industry figures are most likely to see them\u2014Las Vegas.<\/p>\n<p>At the giant annual International Consumer Electronics Show (CES) a few years ago, Microsoft founder Bill Gates happened by Cobra\u2019s 3,300-square-foot booth and spent 20 minutes chatting with Cobra Chairman and CEO Jim Bazet. <i>Good Morning America<\/i> had set up its cameras inside Cobra\u2019s booth, and reporters from virtually all the major news media passed by regularly. \u201cWhere else,\u201d asked Bazet at the time, \u201ccould a $100 million company get such valuable exposure?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Cobra is a global leader in CB radios, radar detection and two-way radios. Recent innovations include the world\u2019s smallest and most powerful radar detector, and the first touch-screen radar, laser and safety camera detector. Cobra displays these and other products at the International CES and at several smaller, more specialized Las Vegas trade shows. Dozens of Cobra\u2019s top people attend these shows, reasoning that there\u2019s no more effective place to interact with customers, bankers, industry analysts and the media.<\/p>\n<p>Besides its superb meeting facilities, the city offers unique opportunities for entertainment and recreation, from great golf courses to many of the nation\u2019s finest restaurants. And behind the scenes, Las Vegas has an unusual wealth of experienced and knowledgeable event planners, plus highly creative design and production specialists.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cPeople are happier going to Las Vegas than to any other meeting site,\u201d says Bazet. \u201cThey come to Las Vegas expecting fun, which is the true reason meetings there are so successful.

Surveillance video and images from the convenience store were also released, depicting what Jackson called a &#8220;strong-arm robbery&#8221; and what the police documents described as a suspect matching Brown&#8217;s description involved in the robbery.<\/p>\n<p>Police have said Brown was killed in a struggle for an officer&#8217;s gun, but at least one witness has disputed that account.<\/p>\n<p>Immediately following the announcement, peaceful protests continued at the QuikTrip convenience store where the police released Darren Wilson&#8217;s name in a press conference.<\/p>\n<p>The town of Ferguson, a suburb of St. Louis, erupted in violence in the days after the shooting, which critics held up as an example of excessive police force and racial inequality in the criminal justice system. Tensions escalated throughout the week as protesters, sometimes violent, were met with heavy-handed policing by Ferguson and St. Louis County police. The situation began to calm on Thursday after Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon pulled the county police from the town and replaced them with state troopers. President Barack Obama also appealed for calm Thursday.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe need to get justice in this case,\u201d Nixon said on MSNBC Friday before the announcement by Ferguson police. \u201cIt\u2019s good news after a great deal of prodding they\u2019re going to release the name of this officer.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe saw an acceleration in the tone and the armor and knew it was time to make a change,\u201d Nixon said. \u201cFolks felt like they were under siege. When police forces work best, they\u2019re part of the community, not a separate force to control that community.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><em>-Additional reporting by Alex Altman \/ Ferguson, Mo.<\/em><\/p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper dark\" data-gallery=\"3103717\" data-title=\"\"><\/div>\n<aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3116794\"><\/div><\/aside>","section":{"name":"U.S.","slug":"us","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/us\/"},"tag":{"name":"Crime","slug":"crime","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/tag\/crime\/"},"tags":"Crime|Ferguson|missourri|Police Brutality|St Louis","hero":{"class":"landscape","thumbnail":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/08\/ferguson-police-chief-3.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1","src":{"small":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/08\/ferguson-police-chief-3.jpg?w=280","small_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/08\/ferguson-police-chief-3.jpg?w=560","large":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/08\/ferguson-police-chief-3.jpg?w=550","large_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/08\/ferguson-police-chief-3.jpg?w=1100"},"credit":"Lucas Jackson\u2014Reuters","caption":"Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson announces the name of the officer involved in the shooting of Michael Brown as officer Darren Wilson, in Ferguson, Missouri Aug. 15, 2014.

the California state legislature passed the <a href=\"http:\/\/leginfo.ca.gov\/pub\/13-14\/bill\/sen\/sb_0601-0650\/sb_610_bill_20140630_amended_asm_v94.pdf\">SB 610<\/a> bill granting franchisees additional rights.<\/p>\n<p>The proposed law pits industry bodies like the International Franchise Association (IFA) and the California Chamber of Commerce against small businesses as well as labor unions like the <span class=\"st\">Service Employees International Union<\/span> (SEIU).<\/p>\n<p>The SEIU argues that the bill&#8217;s passage will pave the way for increased wages and benefits for employees, as franchisees no longer have to worry about the threat of contract termination for introducing such benefits.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cCorporate headquarters control nearly every aspect of our business \u2014 we can be punished for speaking out or joining with other franchise owners to improve business conditions, and the franchises can even be shut down for arbitrary reasons \u2014 as mine

first wave of National Guard troops has taken up observation posts along the Texas-Mexico border.<\/p>\n<p>Several dozen soldiers deployed in the Rio Grande Valley are part of the up to 1,000 troops called up by Gov. Rick Perry last month, Texas National Guard Master Sgt. Ken Walker of the Joint Counterdrug Task Force said Thursday.<\/p>\n<p>Several guardsmen were seen Thursday afternoon manning an observation tower along the busy road leading to the Hidalgo International Bridge.<\/p>\n<p>This first batch of soldiers was specifically trained to man such observation towers in the area belonging to local law enforcement agencies and U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Walker said. They will serve as extra eyes on the border and report suspicious activity to authorities.<\/p>\n<p>State officials have estimated the deployment will cost $12 million per month. Perry said the soldiers were necessary to help secure the border while the Border Patrol was busy with a surge in illegal immigration.<\/p>\n<p>From October to July, 63,000 unaccompanied children were arrested after entering the U.S. illegally, double the number from the same period a year earlier. Another 63,000 families \u2014 mothers or fathers with young children \u2014 were arrested during that period.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re just there for support,&#8221; Walker said of the soldiers. &#8220;We&#8217;re just trying to give some relief to the guys at Customs and Border Protection&#8221; and other law enforcement agencies.<\/p>\n<p>The guardsmen seen Thursday were manning a tower owned by the Hidalgo Police Department.<\/p>\n<p>Hidalgo Police Chief Rodolfo Espinoza said he would normally not have his department&#8217;s two towers manned. They have cameras that can pan the area and record activity, but having a person that can recognize something suspicious and report it is more valuable, he said.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It is good to have them,&#8221; Espinoza said of the soldiers. &#8220;It is a positive benefit for everybody.&#8221;<\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3114047\"><\/div><\/aside>","section":{"name":"U.S.","slug":"us","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/us\/"},"tag":{"name":"Texas","slug":"texas","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/tag\/texas\/"},"tags":"Immigration|rick perry|Texas","hero":{"class":"landscape","thumbnail":"http:\/\/i0.wp.com\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/08\/rick-perry.jpg?crop=375px%2C147px%2C2906px%2C2906px&resize=100%2C100","src":{"small":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/08\/rick-perry.jpg?w=280","small_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/08\/rick-perry.jpg?w=560","large":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/08\/rick-perry.jpg?w=550","large_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/08\/rick-perry.jpg?w=1100"},"credit":"Tony Gutierrez\u2014AP","caption":"Governor Rick Perry pauses as he addresses attendees at the 2014 Red State Gathering on August 8, 2014, in Fort Worth, Texas.","alt":"Governor Rick Perry pauses as he addresses attendees at the 2014 Red State Gathering on August 8, 2014, in Fort Worth, Texas."},"id":3114047,"encoded_url":"http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3114047%2Ffirst-national-guard-troops-texas-mexico-border%2F","encoded_shortlink":"http%3A%2F%2Fti.me%2F1pQb6nT","encoded_title":"First+National+Guard+Troops+at+Texas-Mexico+Border","twitter_text":"First%20National%20Guard%20troops%20at%20Texas-Mexico%20border","twitter_via":"TIME","Partner_Module":{"partner":"Select","post_title":"First National Guard Troops at Texas-Mexico Border "},"email_title":"First%20National%20Guard%20Troops%20at%20Texas-Mexico%20Border%20%7C%20TIME","email_body":"First%20National%20Guard%20Troops%20at%20Texas-Mexico%20Border%0A%0A%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3114047%2Ffirst-national-guard-troops-texas-mexico-border%2F","omniture":{"modules":"rr-taboola-video|rr-ad"}},{"url":"http:\/\/time.com\/3116418\/car-auction-ferrari-record\/","right_now":true,"shortlink":"http:\/\/ti.me\/1pwzQTa","title":"A Ferrari Just Sold for a Record Price at Auction","post_type":"post","time_article":true,"comments_allowed":true,"short_title":"A Ferrari Just Sold for a Record Price at Auction","excerpt":"Nets $38.1 million","format":"brief","time":{"pretty":"7:40 AM ET","published":"2014-08-15 07:40:56","updated":"2014-08-15 11:40:56","minute":"7:40 am","short":"7:40 AM ET"},"authors":[{"id":207071759,"url":"http:\/\/time.com\/author\/time-staff\/","name":"TIME Staff","bio":"","twitter":"","twitter_url":"","gplus":"","fb":"","email":"","thumbnail":null}],"content":"<p>A rare 1962 Ferrari model was <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bonhams.com\/press_release\/17205\/\" target=\"_blank\">sold<\/a> for $38.1 million in California on Thursday, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2014\/08\/15\/automobiles\/collectibles\/bonhams-auctions-a-ferrari-250-gto-for-38-million-at-pebble-beach.html?_r=0\" target=\"_blank\">setting a new record<\/a> for the most expensive car auction ever.<\/p>\n<p>The 1962 Ferrari 250 GTO Berlinetta, one of just 36 of the cars built in the early 1960s, fell short of expectations that it would garner in excess of $50 million at auction.

Instead of a handful of experts\u2014war-planners, for example\u2014it relies on a constellation of thousands or more individuals, often unpaid, who funnel their ideas into a central clearinghouse, where the optimum ones supposedly float to the surface.<\/p>\n<p>The military is already using crowdsourcing on a more limited scale, to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.darpa.mil\/NewsEvents\/Releases\/2013\/04\/22.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">design<\/a> a next-generation combat vehicle and <a href=\"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/08\/dsb.png\" target=\"_blank\">considering<\/a> its potential to help track nuclear proliferation.<\/p>\n<p>But this latest proposal could put crowdsourcing\u2019s fruits inside the Tank, the top-secret Pentagon lair where the nation\u2019s senior generals and admirals train, equip and conduct the nation\u2019s wars.<\/p>\n<p>The Defense Department stresses that the crowdsourcerer it hires will only \u201cenhance the Department\u2019s understanding of the future security environment\u201d and won\u2019t actually be drafting war plans. But it\u2019s encouraging creative thinking: \u201cAn understanding of a range of alternative futures and the types of national security challenges they may present is necessary to inform strategy development and force planning analysis within the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense [for] Policy.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The Pentagon wants the &#8220;crowd-sourcing entity&#8221; to produce these three \u201cPerformance Objectives\u201d:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>a. Identify alternative futures and global and regional security environments in the 2020-2025 timeframe that considers military, sociological, economic, scientific, technological, and environmental trends and potential shocks with implications for the Department.<\/p>\n<p>b. Generate innovative scenarios that present pathways to a crisis or conflict that is antithetical to U.S. national security interests. Scenarios will provide a narrative description that captures a representative potential future national security challenge and includes the following key elements: identity of key actors, their interests and objectives, primary drivers to conflict and rationale for key actors\u2019 decision-making and actions, key capabilities they could use in a crisis or conflict, description of representative activities they would take (i.e., the manner in which they would use their capabilities to achieve their objectives), and role of third parties. Scenarios should remain within the bounds of plausibility.<\/p>\n<p>c. Develop and provide quick-turn analyses exploring the implications for the Department on new and\/or potentially game-changing military capabilities of the adversary identified in the alternative futures environment and\/or the innovative scenarios to inform the development of alternative strategies and force planning options to mitigate the impacts of the capabilities.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>\u201cThere is no requirement for the work to be conducted at the Pentagon,\u201d the solicitation adds, \u201cwith the exception of periodic briefings of deliverables as stated in the Performance Objectives.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re interested in helping hone the nation\u2019s future war-fighting environment, you\u2019d better get cracking. The Pentagon is seeking a three-year deal beginning next month, and the deadline to apply is Sept. 4. \u201cA written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party,\u201d the Pentagon adds. The winner will not have access to classified information, which could help things.<\/p>\n<p>The solicitation warns that it may reject any bidder whose offer \u201cis evaluated to be unrealistic in terms of program commitments, including contract terms and conditions, or unrealistically high or low in cost\/price when compared to Government estimates, such that the proposal is deemed to reflect an inherent lack of competence or failure to comprehend the complexity and risks of the program.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAn inherent lack of competence or failure to comprehend the complexity and risks of the program?\u201d Talk about unilateral disarmament.

Aging, Insecurity and the $2 Billion Testosterone Industry<\/h3><\/a><\/div><\/aside><p>Al-Maliki made the announcement on national television late Thursday, standing alongside senior members of his Islamic Dawa Party, including rival Haider al-Abadi. He said he was stepping aside in favor of his &#8220;brother,&#8221; in order to &#8220;facilitate the political process and government formation.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The premier-designate al-Abadi, a veteran Shiite lawmaker, now faces the immense challenge of trying to unite Iraqi politicians. The country&#8217;s major political factions deeply distrust each other and the army seems unable to regain territory in the north and west taken by militants from the Islamic State group.<\/p>\n<p>Al-Maliki had been struggling for weeks to stay on for a third four-year term as prime minister amid an attempt by opponents to push him out, accusing him of monopolizing power and pursuing a fiercely pro-Shiite agenda that has alienated the Sunni minority.<\/p>\n<p>The United States, the U.N. and a broad array of political factions in Iraq had backed al-Abadi, saying only a new leader could unify a country under siege from the Islamic State extremists who have captured large swaths of Iraqi territory.<\/p>\n<p>Al-Maliki said his decision reflected a desire to &#8220;safeguard the high interests of the country,&#8221; adding that he would not be the cause of any bloodshed.<\/p>\n<p>His refusal to give up the post after eight years in power had provoked a political crisis that escalated this week in Baghdad. The pressure intensified when his Shiite political alliance backed al-Abadi to replace him, and President Fouad Massoum nominated al-Abadi on Monday to form the next government. Al-Maliki threatened legal action against the president for what he said was a violation of the constitution.<\/p>\n<p>But in a meeting of his party earlier Thursday, al-Maliki agreed to endorse al-Abadi, two senior lawmakers from his State of Law parliamentary bloc \u2014 Hussein al-Maliki and Khalaf Abdul-Samad \u2014 told The Associated Press. The two said al-Maliki also agreed to drop a suit before the constitutional court challenging al-Abadi&#8217;s nomination.<\/p>\n<p>The White House commended al-Maliki&#8217;s move and expressed hope that the power shift &#8220;can set Iraq on a new path and unite its people&#8221; against the threat from Islamic militants, national security adviser Susan Rice said in a statement.<\/p>\n<p>U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said the move &#8220;sets the stage for a historic and peaceful transition of power in Iraq.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Al-Maliki had grown increasingly isolated as he was deserted not only by his Shiite allies but also top ally Iran, the United States and the U.N. backed al-Abadi, who has 30 days to put together a Cabinet for parliament&#8217;s approval.<\/p>\n<p>The U.N. Security Council urged al-Abadi to work swiftly to form &#8220;an inclusive government that represents all segments of the Iraqi population and that contributes to finding a viable and sustainable solution to the country&#8217;s current challenges.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Iraqis of all sects welcomed Thursday&#8217;s announcement.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Now, all we want is a government that respects the people and does not discriminate against them,&#8221; said Youssef Ibrahim, 40, a Sunni government employee in Baghdad.<\/p>\n<p>Adnan Hussein, 45, a Shiite in Sadr City, said he believes al-Maliki is to blame for much of Iraq&#8217;s troubles. &#8220;The years he ruled were the worst in Iraq&#8217;s history and he bears that responsibility,&#8221; Hussein said.<\/p>\n<p>The U.S. and other countries have been pushing for a more representative government that will ease anger among Sunnis, who felt marginalized by al-Maliki&#8217;s administration, which helped fuel the dramatic sweep by the Islamic State extremist group.<\/p>\n<p>The militants&#8217; lightning advance across much of northern and western Iraq since June has driven hundreds of thousands of people from their homes, and last week prompted the U.S. to launch aid operations and airstrikes as the militants threatened religious minorities and the largely autonomous Kurdish region.<\/p>\n<p>The U.N. on Wednesday declared the situation in Iraq a &#8220;Level 3 Emergency&#8221; \u2014 a decision that came after some 45,000 members of the Yazidi religious minority were able to escape from a remote desert mountaintop where they had been encircled by Islamic State fighters, who view them as apostates and had vowed to kill any who did not convert to Islam.<\/p>\n<p>The U.N. said it would provide increased support to the Yazidis and to 400,000 other Iraqis who have fled since June to the Kurdish province of Dahuk. A total of 1.5 million people have been displaced by the fighting.<\/p>\n<p>The United States has been carrying out airstrikes in recent days against Islamic State fighters, helping fend back their advance on Kurdish regions.<\/p>\n<p>The European Union&#8217;s foreign ministers will hold an emergency meeting Friday on Iraq to coordinate their stance on military support for the Kurds and on providing humanitarian assistance for those fleeing the fighting.<\/p>\n<p>___<\/p>\n<p>Abdul-Zahra reported from Boston.

In an eye-opening report published in the journal <a href=\"http:\/\/bmjopen.bmj.com\/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>BMJ Open<\/em><\/a>, Dr. Renee Hsia, an associate professor of emergency medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, and her colleagues found that cholesterol panel could cost patients anywhere from $10 to $10,169 \u2014 a more than thousand-fold difference. A basic metabolic test for things like blood sugar ranged from $35 to $7,303.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI was expecting a little variation, maybe two-fold, or even three-fold,\u201d says Hsia, who also studied differences in total costs for procedures like having the appendix or tonsils removed. \u201cBut I wasn\u2019t expecting this amount.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>She focused specifically on blood tests because they are automated and not prone to variations in the quality of the technician or other bells and whistles required to spit out results. \u201cIt should be like buying a loaf of bread,\u201d she says, with only slight differences in price.<\/p>\n<p><strong>MORE:<\/strong> <a href=\"http:\/\/swampland.time.com\/2013\/05\/08\/an-end-to-medical-billing-secrecy\/\" target=\"_blank\">An End to Medical-Billing Secrecy?<\/a><\/p>\n<p>But the thousand-fold range shows just how seemingly random health care pricing can be. \u201cThere is probably nothing justifiable [for the high cost] in this case,\u201d she says. Even if the most talented technician were performing the lipid analysis using the most sophisticated machine, it\u2019s hard to imagine those services requiring $10,000 worth of equipment or labor.<\/p>\n<p>And it\u2019s not as if individual hospitals are guilty of overcharging consistently. One hospital may have high fees for one test and lower fees for others. In Hsia\u2019s study of 150 California hospitals, the one that charged more than $10,000 for the cholesterol test was not the same one that billed more than $7,000 for a metabolic test. Factoring in things such as whether the hospital was for- or not-for-profit, whether it was a teaching hospital, and the percentage of patients covered by Medicaid still didn\u2019t explain the gap in pricing.<\/p>\n<p><strong>MORE:<\/strong> <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/198\/bitter-pill-why-medical-bills-are-killing-us\/\" target=\"_blank\">Bitter Pill: Why Medical Bills Are Killing Us<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Master lists at each hospital set these fees, she says, and in recent years, some hospital administrators have admitted that even quantitative factors such as supply, demand or overhead costs don\u2019t factor into these prices. In 2013, Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius <a href=\"http:\/\/swampland.time.com\/2013\/05\/08\/an-end-to-medical-billing-secrecy\/\" target=\"_blank\">released the prices of 100 of the most common inpatient services<\/a> at hospitals across the country in an effort to make the process more transparent.<\/p>\n<p>And if you think you won\u2019t have to worry about these prices because you\u2019re insured, you may be feeling these costs the next time your premium creeps up. While private insurers negotiate with hospitals to accept certain fees, that rate is a percentage of the original charge \u2014 the higher the charge, the higher that negotiated fee will be. And insurers pass on those costs to their members.<\/p>\n<p>So can a financially responsible patient comparison shop for hospitals with the most reasonable fees? Not really.<\/p>\n<p>California law mandates that hospital report what they charge for any 25 of the most common outpatient tests. But they don\u2019t specify what those tests are, and hospitals can chose which ones they provide to the public. The entire list of fees is also available, but not as easy to navigate for patients who aren\u2019t familiar with the codes for the tests. \u201cIt\u2019s not that transparent, and hard for patients to access the information,\u201d says Hsia.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhen people hear about price variation, they say it\u2019s probably just one hospital, or one blood test or one procedure, and they think it\u2019s the exception rather than the rule,\u201d says Hsia. But evidence is mounting that&#8217;s not the case. &#8220;It\u2019s not a hospital issue, it\u2019s a fundamental problem because there is not a rational way to determine hospital pricing, and that needs to be addressed.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3112985\"><\/div><\/aside>","section":{"name":"Health","slug":"health","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/health\/"},"tag":{"name":"Health Care","slug":"health-care","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/tag\/health-care\/"},"tags":"blood test|blood test costs|Health Care|health care costs","id":3112985,"encoded_url":"http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3112985%2Fyour-next-blood-test-could-cost-10000%2F","encoded_shortlink":"http%3A%2F%2Fti.me%2F1rxfR4W","encoded_title":"Your+Next+Blood+Test+Could+Cost+%2410%2C000","twitter_text":"How%20much%20does%20a%20blood%20test%20cost%3F%20Maybe%20%2410%2C000","twitter_via":"TIMEHealth","Partner_Module":{"partner":"Select","post_title":"Your Next Blood Test Could Cost $10,000"},"email_title":"Your%20Next%20Blood%20Test%20Could%20Cost%20%2410%2C000%20%7C%20TIME","email_body":"Your%20Next%20Blood%20Test%20Could%20Cost%20%2410%2C000%0A%0AThat%E2%80%99s%20how%20much%20one%20Cal.%20hospital%20charges%20for%20a%20routine%20cholesterol%20test.%20Others%20charged%20as%20little%20as%20%2410%20for%20the%20exact%20same%20assay%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3112985%2Fyour-next-blood-test-could-cost-10000%2F","omniture":{"modules":"rr-taboola-video|rr-partner|rr-ad"}},{"url":"http:\/\/time.com\/3111943\/ask-fm-barry-diller\/","right_now":true,"shortlink":"http:\/\/ti.me\/1sZxlYK","title":"Barry Diller Wants to Save the Web&#8217;s Most Controversial Social Network","post_type":"post","time_article":true,"comments_allowed":true,"short_title":"Barry Diller Wants to Save Ask.fm","excerpt":"In purchasing Ask.fm, which is used by 120 million people worldwide, the Internet mogul is betting he can clean up a star-crossed site","format":"article","time":{"pretty":"Aug. 14, 2014","published":"2014-08-14 18:25:40","updated":"2014-08-14 22:25:40","minute":"6:25 pm","short":"8\/14"},"authors":[{"id":208290421,"url":"http:\/\/time.com\/author\/jack-dickey\/","name":"Jack Dickey","bio":"Jack Dickey is a reporter for TIME focused on culture and sports.

Aging, Insecurity and the $2 Billion Testosterone Industry<\/h3><\/a><\/div><\/aside><p>If you don&#8217;t know about the social network, find a teenager and, well, ask. The site has 120 million worldwide users, nearly half of whom are high school age, with more than 10 percent residing in the United States. Users sign up and open themselves to questions from anyone\u2014classmates, peers, mysterious Internet trawlers\u2014posed both anonymously and with names attached. Rarely do they urge suicide in a plain, literal fashion. Often they instead tackle the trivial business of high school (homework, crushes, the social pecking order). But the effect even then is of a virtual locker room, one filled with gossip and catcalls, one that follows you home, on the always-on smartphone stuffed in your pocket.<\/p>\n<p>Earlier this summer, <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/2926428\/ask-fm-the-antisocial-network\/\" target=\"_blank\">I wrote about the site<\/a> and its effect on the brawny yet brittle teenage brain, which according to mental-health experts chases immediate rewards without much regard for the long-term consequences. Teenagers get hooked on something before they figure out how, why and what it means.<\/p>\n<p>That sense of excitement and uncertainty appears in Ask.fm&#8217;s origin story too. Two brothers, Ilja and Mark Terebin, ages 35 and 29, founded the site in 2010 only in search of a social network to make them a buck. It grew so big, and so quickly, that only later did they develop a philosophy to justify its existence. The site, <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/2923146\/ask-fm-interview\/\" target=\"_blank\">they said in an interview in April<\/a>, would aid in teenagers&#8217; self-discovery through expanding freedom and opportunities for self-expression. And they said the media outlets that had criticized them over lax safety standards, not Ask.fm&#8217;s users, were the real bullies.<\/p>\n<p>But it&#8217;s a common story in entrepreneurship\u2014every young, scrappy company is one day forced to grow up. And sometimes a grown-up company has no need for the young people who built it: The Terebins will leave Ask.fm and have no further affiliation with it, although headquarters, and the site&#8217;s employees, will remain for the time being in their home city of Riga. Leeds says, &#8220;They&#8217;re smart and passionate people, but they had a philosophy for the company that was incorrect.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>When asked his plans for the future, Ilja replied in an e-mail, &#8220;Fruits and vegetables, books and a billion dollar idea. : ).&#8221; IAC declined to disclose how much the company paid for the site.<\/p>\n<p>Ask.fm&#8217;s new owners insist they will be zealous about users&#8217; safety. Before completing the deal, they partnered with two state attorneys general\u2014New York&#8217;s Eric Schneiderman and Maryland&#8217;s Douglas Gansler\u2014and produced a detailed agreement outlining new safety standards. The site has agreed to expand its content-monitoring team, work with suicide-prevention groups and will hire an outside safety consultant who will monitor the site&#8217;s compliance with the agreement and other safety standards. The site has also brought aboard Catherine Teitelbaum, Yahoo&#8217;s former director of global safety and product policy, as its chief trust and safety officer. She says she has an aggressive timetable for cleaning the site up.<\/p>\n<p>Leeds, the new CEO, says the site has a great deal of untapped potential for genuine online self-expression and interaction, less inorganic and forced than Twitter, Instagram or Facebook (social networks alongside which he sees Ask.fm one day sitting). He says, &#8220;There&#8217;s no blank-box problem, where you have to think about what to say. People are already asking <em>you<\/em> questions.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Set aside momentarily safety and user experience, the major areas Ask&#8217;s new bosses plan to address. The broader question\u2014what effect endless access to the opinions of one&#8217;s peers has on vulnerable teenagers\u2014persists. But maybe it, like over a billion others each month, will someday be answered by way of Ask.fm.<\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3111943\"><\/div><\/aside>","section":{"name":"Business","slug":"business","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/business\/"},"tag":{"name":"Internet","slug":"internet","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/tag\/internet\/"},"tags":"ask.fm|barry diller|IAC|ilja and mark terebin|Internet|social networks","hero":{"class":"landscape","thumbnail":"http:\/\/i0.wp.com\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/08\/barry-diller.jpg?crop=2030px%2C217px%2C789px%2C789px&resize=100%2C100","src":{"small":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/08\/barry-diller.jpg?w=280","small_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/08\/barry-diller.jpg?w=560","large":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/08\/barry-diller.jpg?w=550","large_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/08\/barry-diller.jpg?w=1100"},"credit":"Bloomberg\/Getty Images","caption":"Diane von Furstenberg and Barry Diller, chairman and chief executive officer of IAC\/InterActiveCorp, arrive for a morning session during the Allen &amp; Co.

So far, of course, they have not had much choice in the matter. Russian President Vladimir Putin did not hold a plebiscite in Russia before deciding in March to annex the region of Crimea from Ukraine. Nor did he ask the public\u2019s opinion before imposing a ban on Western food imports on Aug. 6 to punish the countries that have sanctioned Russia in response to the Crimean land grab. The food ban was simply <a href=\"http:\/\/eng.kremlin.ru\/news\/22780\" target=\"_blank\">imposed<\/a> by a Kremlin decree &#8220;to protect Russia&#8217;s security,&#8221; and the predictable result was a run on supermarkets in Moscow and other cities, a spike in prices and panic buying in the dairy aisle.<\/p>\n<aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-mag\" data-name=\"rr-mag\"><div class=\"read-more-inline magazine has-cover\"><h6 class=\"read-more-list-h read-more-popular\">Popular Among Subscribers<\/h6>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"popular-lead\"><a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3110842\/robin-williams-the-heart-of-comedy\/?pcd=pw-pas\"><img title=\"\" alt=\"Eat Butter Fat Time Magazine Cover\" src=\"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/06\/fat-cover.jpg?w=560\" data-loaded=\"true\"><\/a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3110842\/robin-williams-the-heart-of-comedy\/?pcd=pw-pas\" class=\"read-more-article\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"read-more-inline-title time-icons time-icons-key\">Robin Williams: The Heart of Comedy<\/h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/subscription.time.com\/storefront\/subscribe-to-time\/link\/1019509.html\" class=\"subscribe-button\">Subscribe<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div><a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3110832\/what-comes-after-ebola\/?pcd=pw-pas\" class=\"read-more-article\" format-video><h3 class=\"read-more-inline-title time-icons time-icons-key\">What Comes After Ebola<\/h3><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3062889\/manopause-aging-insecurity-and-the-2-billion-testosterone-industry\/?pcd=pw-pas\" class=\"read-more-article\" format-article><h3 class=\"read-more-inline-title time-icons time-icons-key\">Manopause?! Aging, Insecurity and the $2 Billion Testosterone Industry<\/h3><\/a><\/div><\/aside><p>It was not the first measure to test the public\u2019s patience on Ukraine. Desperate for cash to develop Crimea, the Russian government has <a href=\"http:\/\/www.project-syndicate.org\/commentary\/sergei-guriev-argues-that-western-sanctions-are-already-biting--and-will-soon-cause-even-more-economic-pain\" target=\"_blank\">dipped<\/a> into the national pension fund, essentially deciding to confiscate everything its citizens will contribute to it this year and the next. \u201cNo one has any intention of giving this money back, because this money has gone to Crimea,\u201d <a href=\"http:\/\/www.interfax.ru\/business\/382558\" target=\"_blank\">said<\/a> Finance Minister Anton Siluanov. (His deputy was promptly fired when he confessed on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sergey.belyakov.18\/posts\/821438977944009\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook<\/a> that he \u201cfeels ashamed\u201d for the expropriation on Aug. 5.) Then there were those hapless Russian travelers, roughly 27,000 of them, who were <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3081227\/russia-tourists-stranded-sanctions-ukraine\/\" target=\"_blank\">stranded<\/a> in airport terminals in early August after a Russian tour operator folded under the weight of Western sanctions. \u201cWe worry that this is only the beginning and that there will be a domino effect,\u201d said a spokesman for Russia\u2019s Federal Tourism Agency.<\/p>\n<p>Indeed there is likely to be. As the sanctions war escalates, it will continue to eat away at Russia\u2019s economic growth \u2014 and ordinary Russians will be forced to confront the question of whether they are prepared to pay for Putin&#8217;s foreign adventurism. In such a scenario, Lev Gudkov, one of Russia\u2019s leading sociologists and director of the Levada Center, an independent pollster, believes that they are unlikely to fall in line behind their leader. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to express support,\u201d he says, \u201cbut quite another to suffer for it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Expressions of support for Putin have lately been almost unanimous. In Levada\u2019s surveys since the crisis began in March, his approval ratings shot up more than 20 percentage points to <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3088126\/putins-popularity-hits-87-russia\/\" target=\"_blank\">reach<\/a> an overwhelming 87% at the end of last month. But that phenomenon has a flip side. Just as Russians applaud Putin for every perceived success in Ukraine, they are likely to fault him for every repercussion. Two-thirds of the population, says Gudkov, place all responsibility for the crisis squarely on Putin and his inner circle rather than on themselves. Only 7% to 12% are prepared to make personal sacrifices for the sake of Russia\u2019s policies in Ukraine, he says. \u201cThe rest take a characteristic position: \u2018Leave me out of it.\u2019\u201d<\/p>\n<p>But short of emigrating, Russians can&#8217;t opt out. They will all have to deal with the fact that <a href=\"http:\/\/online.wsj.com\/articles\/russians-brace-for-higher-food-bills-1407523605\" target=\"_blank\">inflation<\/a> is due to reach up to 9% this year, while the Finance Ministry has <a href=\"http:\/\/itar-tass.com\/ekonomika\/1377918\" target=\"_blank\">proposed<\/a> a new sales tax of 3% to plug holes in the federal budget that have largely resulted from the crisis in Ukraine. Diabetics in Russia are having to <a href=\"http:\/\/newdaynews.ru\/ekb\/508380.html\" target=\"_blank\">stock up<\/a> on insulin just in case it winds up on the import ban as well. People with special diets, including professional athletes, are <a href=\"http:\/\/neinvalid.ru\/glyuten-doverie-i-akkuratnyie-sanktsii\/\" target=\"_blank\">scrambling<\/a> to find Russian alternatives to the Western foods they need. \u201cNobody wants prices to rise,\u201d said Arkady Dvorkovich, the government\u2019s chief economic adviser, in trying to calm the public during a television <a href=\"http:\/\/www.vesti.ru\/only_video.html?vid=614434\" target=\"_blank\">appearance<\/a> on Aug. 13. \u201cNobody wants hoarding. Nobody wants deficits.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Yet that is what Russians can expect, and the task of making them accept this reality, and even embrace it, has fallen to the Kremlin\u2019s propaganda outlets \u2014 and they have dusted off the Cold War creeds of self-sufficiency in trying to lift the nation&#8217;s spirits.<\/p>\n<p>One of the more typical examples of the genre was <a href=\"http:\/\/www.kp.ru\/daily\/26261.7\/3142188\/\" target=\"_blank\">published<\/a> in <em>Komsomolskaya Pravda<\/em>, Russia\u2019s most popular newspaper, on Aug. 3, a few days before Putin imposed the ban on Western food. Under the headline \u201cHard Times Await,\u201d the piece lashed out at fast-food chains like McDonald\u2019s and waxed nostalgic for the Soviet treats that Russians remember from childhood. \u201cWhen the Iron Curtain fell, meat patties on round buns seemed to us like symbols of freedom,\u201d wrote the author, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.newyorker.com\/news\/daily-comment\/putins-nightingales\" target=\"_blank\">Ulyana Skoibeda<\/a>. \u201cNow our national leader [Putin] has declared that Ossetian pastries and Tatar pies can compete with American hamburgers. It is a total reorientation. From looking outward, we turn in, from the West, into ourselves.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>All of this, she argued, should come naturally to Russians, as though they are just lapsed believers being shepherded back to their traditional faith. But the author (perhaps because she was about 14 years old when the Iron Curtain fell) neglects to mention how tight the cuffs of isolation were back then, and what a relief it was when they came off.<\/p>\n<p>Even the Soviet elites had trouble believing the extent to which they\u2019d been deprived. In the fall of 1989, two years before he was elected post-Soviet Russia&#8217;s first President, Boris Yeltsin took a tour of an American supermarket for the first time in his life. It was a typical franchise of the Randall\u2019s grocery chain in Houston, the sort of place where workaday Texans did their weekly shopping. But as Yeltsin\u2019s adviser, Lev Sukhanov, later recalled with almost childlike wonder in his <a href=\"http:\/\/www.litres.ru\/lev-suhanov\/kak-elcin-stal-prezidentom-zapiski-pervogo-pomoschnika\/?action=update_my_reg&amp;code1=0991573886335689&amp;just_bought=1&amp;mail=vsvs55%40gmail.com&amp;timestamp=1407749446888&amp;utc_offset_min=120\" target=\"_blank\">memoirs<\/a>, \u201cit felt like we were standing right in the middle of a kaleidoscope.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Yeltsin had never seen anything in Moscow, not even at the exclusive shops reserved for the chiefs of the Communist Party, that could compare to the gastronomical wonderland he found inside that Randall\u2019s store. \u201cThe gleaming radishes the size of plump potatoes,\u201d Sukhanov recounted, \u201cthe pineapples, the bananas.\u201d There were some 30,000 items on the shelves, including more types of sausage than the Kremlin delegates could count. \u201cThe eye could not enumerate all the different kinds of candy and cakes, could not process the variety of their colors, their delicious attractiveness,\u201d Sukhanov wrote. \u201cIt came as a deep shock.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Later that day, as they flew from Houston to Miami to continue their official visit as members of the Soviet legislature, Sukhanov remembers Yeltsin sitting with his head in his hands. When he finally came out of his stupor, according to the memoirs, he said, \u201cWhat have we brought our poor people to? All our lives we\u2019ve been telling them fairy tales. All our lives we\u2019ve been inventing. But the world had already invented everything long ago.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Almost exactly 15 years after Yeltsin handed power over to Putin, the old fairy tales of Soviet dogma are being revived. Having gathered the entire Russian legislature in Crimea on Aug. 14, Putin told them in a speech that the ban on Western food was just a means of \u201csupporting the product manufacturers of the fatherland.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>That has been a favorite talking point on Kremlin news outlets lately. In calling for Russians to embrace a patriotic diet, they have claimed that the domestic food industry has \u201cthe chance of a lifetime\u201d to replace Western imports, which are in any case unhealthy and not all that good. But even some of Putin\u2019s own spin doctors have had trouble sticking to that line.<\/p>\n<p>During a radio <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=4zXwsu2IXSA&amp;feature=youtu.be\" target=\"_blank\">program<\/a> on a Kremlin-owned station on Aug. 10, the host went on a half-hour rant about the \u201cstupidity\u201d of trying to replace Western goods with Russian ones. \u201cIt\u2019s all a catastrophe,\u201d said Vladimir Solovyov, one of the most popular television personalities in Russia and usually one of the Kremlin&#8217;s favorite messengers. \u201cWhat are we going to do, replace honey with crap? That doesn\u2019t mean the crap will taste like honey &#8230; Don\u2019t lie to yourself.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>His co-host, growing nervous as the live broadcast continued, tried weakly to convince him that Russia would manage, just as it did in the Soviet Union. Solovyov persisted: \u201cI want to make my own choices, and not to have the state choose for me,\u201d he said. \u201cI want the right to choose for myself what wine I drink, and if I\u2019m told that I don\u2019t have this right, then I want to be convinced that I\u2019m accepting these discomforts for a good cause.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>But is the conflict in Ukraine a good enough cause? Is it worth having to part with the comforts that Russians now take for grant? To give up the \u201ckaleidoscope\u201d of Western produce now available in Russian supermarkets? These are not easy questions, and it will be a lot harder to answer them with a resounding yes than it was to support the swift and easy annexation of Crimea. And as the consequences of that decision unfold, they will begin to weigh on Putin\u2019s sky-high popularity. Gudkov, the sociologist, expects the President&#8217;s ratings to sink by November back to what they were before the annexation of Crimea. But that does not mean Putin will change course.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cNobody supported the Soviet policy of isolation either,\u201d says Gudkov. \u201cIt was very painful for people, that feeling of slouching toward a dead end. But nobody asked the public\u2019s opinion whether they wanted this or not.\u201d They simply had to pay the price for their leaders\u2019 decisions. Then as now, nobody gave them much of a choice.<\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\"

time-icons time-icons-key\">Manopause?! Aging, Insecurity and the $2 Billion Testosterone Industry<\/h3><\/a><\/div><\/aside><p>The extra cost \u2014 a minuscule part of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice&#8217;s $3 billion annual budget \u2014 comes after the state&#8217;s previous supplier refused to provide more of the powerful sedative last year, claiming it had become a target of execution opponents. Prison officials have since found a new compound pharmacy for pentobarbital, and have waged a successful legal battle to keep the business&#8217; name secret.<\/p>\n<p>Backlash from capital punishment adversaries has curtailed the number of mainstream drug companies willing to provide lethal chemical doses to states. But it&#8217;s not clear whether the increased cost is tied to that. Industry groups and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration say they do not track prices for the drug and could not speculate on what factors might have driven the cost up for Texas.<\/p>\n<p>Several other state prison agencies have refused to release details on their drug purchases and Texas officials also have declined to comment on details.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re confident we&#8217;re complying with all state and federal laws,&#8221; Clark said.<\/p>\n<p>The agency&#8217;s higher cost does not appear extraordinary. A survey of nearly two dozen pharmacies in the Houston area shows Nembutal, the brand name for pentobarbital, sells for about $1,500.<\/p>\n<p>The cost is a bargain compared to Missouri, which also uses pentobarbital for executions. Records earlier this year showed state officials paid as much as $8,000 per dose.<\/p>\n<p>At least 10 inmates have execution dates in the coming months, including two in September, which means Texas&#8217; latest batch of pentobarbital is set to run out by the end of the year. The agency has confirmed it will attempt to purchase more drugs, but prison spokesman Jason Clark would not address whether the agency expects costs to rise further or whether it will use the same supplier.<\/p>\n<p>The latest drug purchase, in mid-March, was made by the warden at the Texas Department of Criminal Justice Huntsville Unit, where executions are carried out. It also included an additional $425 for tests to ensure the drugs&#8217; potency.<\/p>\n<p>Texas and many other death penalty states confronted with execution-drug shortages have turned to compounding pharmacies, which custom-make medications that the FDA considers unapproved and does not verify their safety or effectiveness. But Texas&#8217; one-drug protocol has avoided the problems found in Ohio, Arizona and Oklahoma, which all use midazolam as part of a two- or three-drug mixture and had executions go awry in the last year.<\/p>\n<p>The records provided to the AP are redacted to conceal references to Texas&#8217; new supplier.<\/p>\n<p>Just a few years ago, it cost $83.55 in Texas for its former three-drug combination of sodium thiopental, pancuronium bromide and potassium chloride administered to condemned prisoners. But Hospira Inc., the sole U.S. manufacturer of sodium thiopental, stopped production in 2010 and dropped plans to produce it in Italy because the government there asked for guarantees it never would be used in executions.<\/p>\n<p>Texas responded by switching to pentobarbital, but Denmark-based Lundbeck Inc., the drug&#8217;s only U.S.-licensed maker, bowed to pressure from death penalty opponents and announced its medication was off-limits for capital punishment.<\/p>\n<p>The Texas prison agency then opted to purchase pentobarbital from The Woodlands Compounding Pharmacy until the Houston-area company refused to provide more drugs in October. The owner wrote a letter to the agency accusing state officials of placing him &#8220;in the middle of a firestorm&#8221; of hate mail and potential litigation when his company&#8217;s name became public.<\/p>\n<p>Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott has supported the prison agency&#8217;s refusal to publicly name its new supplier, citing a &#8220;threat assessment&#8221; signed by Texas Department of Public Safety director Steven McCraw that says pharmacies selling execution drugs face &#8220;a substantial threat of physical harm.&#8221;<\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3117937\"><\/div><\/aside>","section":{"name":"U.S.","slug":"us","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/us\/"},"id":3117937,"encoded_url":"http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3117937%2Fexecution-drug-cost-quadruples-for-texas-prisons%2F","encoded_shortlink":"http%3A%2F%2Fti.me%2F1pxjz0h","encoded_title":"Execution+Drug+Cost+Quadruples+for+Texas+Prisons","twitter_text":"Execution%20Drug%20Cost%20Quadruples%20for%20Texas%20Prisons","twitter_via":"TIME","Partner_Module":{"partner":"Select","post_title":"Execution Drug Cost Quadruples for Texas Prisons "},"email_title":"Execution%20Drug%20Cost%20Quadruples%20for%20Texas%20Prisons%20%7C%20TIME","email_body":"Execution%20Drug%20Cost%20Quadruples%20for%20Texas%20Prisons%0A%0A%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3117937%2Fexecution-drug-cost-quadruples-for-texas-prisons%2F","omniture":{"modules":"rr-taboola-video|rr-partner|rr-mag|rr-ad"}},{"url":"http:\/\/time.com\/3117312\/michael-brown-ferguson-j-cole-be-free\/","shortlink":"http:\/\/ti.me\/1sJivZM","title":"J.

Samsung hasn&#8217;t disclosed the price, but <a href=\"http:\/\/recode.net\/2014\/08\/14\/internet-of-bling-samsung-buys-smartthings-for-200-million\/\" target=\"_blank\">Re\/code claims<\/a> the company paid roughly $200 million. SmartThings says it will remain an open platform and will operate independently within Samsung&#8217;s Open Innovation Center.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s how SmartThings works: First, you buy <a href=\"https:\/\/shop.smartthings.com\/#!\/products\/smartthings-hub\" target=\"_blank\">a $99 hub<\/a> that allows all your devices and appliances to connect. Then, you tack on whatever other <a href=\"https:\/\/shop.smartthings.com\/#!\/\" target=\"_blank\">home automation gear<\/a> you want, such as power outlets, light switches, motion sensors and door locks. The hub then connects to your Internet router, allowing you to control everything via smartphone or tablet whether you&#8217;re home or away.<\/p>\n<p>SmartThings got its start as a Kickstarter project in 2012, but over the last couple years, many larger companies have launched similar products with hubs that control an array of other devices. Lowe&#8217;s has a smart home system called <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lowes.com\/cd_Products_1337707661000_\" target=\"_blank\">Iris<\/a>, while Home Depot has backed <a href=\"http:\/\/www.winkapp.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Wink<\/a>, an offshoot of New York-based design shop Quirky. Staples has its own platform, called <a href=\"http:\/\/www.staples.com\/Staples-Connect-Home-Control\/cat_SC5529\" target=\"_blank\">Connect<\/a>, and Best Buy is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.zatznotfunny.com\/2014-08\/meet-peq-the-next-smart-home-hub\/\" target=\"_blank\">reportedly backing a new effort<\/a> called Peq.<\/p>\n<p>But there isn&#8217;t a huge difference between each of these platforms, and right now the landscape is a bit messy. If you&#8217;re in the market for a home automation system, it&#8217;s tough to decide which one to pick. And there&#8217;s so much expensive, proprietary hardware on each platform that you could easily lock yourself into to one system that doesn&#8217;t end up being the best fit.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps that&#8217;s why other tech giants such as Google and Apple are moving more cautiously. Earlier this year, Google <a href=\"http:\/\/techland.time.com\/2014\/01\/13\/googles-nest-acquisition-is-a-3-2-billion-bet-on-the-internet-of-things\/\" target=\"_blank\">acquired Nest<\/a>, whose only products are a smart thermostat and smoke detector. (Nest itself has since acquired <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/2908151\/google-nest-dropcam-cameras\/\" target=\"_blank\">Dropcam<\/a>, a maker of video-monitoring cameras.) Apple hasn&#8217;t yet entered the hardware fray, but the next version of iOS will include <a href=\"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/homekit\/\" target=\"_blank\">HomeKit<\/a>, a framework for controlling third-party devices. There&#8217;s been some speculation that <a href=\"http:\/\/www.macworld.com\/article\/2364315\/apples-homekit-hub-may-already-be-in-your-house.html\" target=\"_blank\">Apple TV could serve as Apple&#8217;s hub<\/a> for home automation in the future.<\/p>\n<p>With that in mind, Samsung&#8217;s purchase is a head-scratcher at first glance. SmartThings isn&#8217;t much different from all the other systems on the market, and probably won&#8217;t get much love at retail, given that every chain now has its own preferred platform.<\/p>\n<p>But Samsung may be able to stand out if it can tie in products from its home appliance business, such as ovens, refrigerators and dishwashers. Although Samsung has dabbled in connected appliances before, until now, it hasn&#8217;t had a complete platform that covers things like door locks and light sensors. With SmartThings, Samsung could be buying itself those basic elements. Use cases like &#8220;make sure the oven&#8217;s off when I leave the house&#8221; could be pretty compelling to homeowners, and it&#8217;s something other platforms won&#8217;t be able to do unless they start partnering with major appliance vendors.<\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3117493\"><\/div><\/aside>","section":{"name":"Tech","slug":"tech","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/tech\/"},"tag":{"name":"Gadgets","slug":"gadgets","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/tag\/gadgets\/"},"tags":"Gadgets|Home automation|Innovation|Samsung|smart home|Smart Homes","hero":{"class":"portrait","thumbnail":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/08\/smartthings.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1","src":{"small":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/08\/smartthings.jpg?w=280","small_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/08\/smartthings.jpg?w=560","large":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/08\/smartthings.jpg?w=407","large_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/08\/smartthings.jpg?w=814"},"credit":"SmartThings","caption":"","alt":""},"id":3117493,"encoded_url":"http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3117493%2Fsamsung-home-automation-smartthings%2F","encoded_shortlink":"http%3A%2F%2Fti.me%2F1uXABoO","encoded_title":"Samsung+Buys+Into+Home+Automation+with+SmartThings+Acquisition","twitter_text":"Samsung%20buys%20into%20home%20automation%20with%20SmartThings%20acquisition%20%7C","twitter_via":"Techland","Partner_Module":{"partner":"Select","post_title":"Samsung Buys Into Home Automation with SmartThings Acquisition"},"email_title":"Samsung%20Buys%20Into%20Home%20Automation%20with%20SmartThings%20Acquisition%20%7C%20TIME","email_body":"Samsung%20Buys%20Into%20Home%20Automation%20with%20SmartThings%20Acquisition%0A%0AThe%20reported%20%24200%20million%20deal%20is%20a%20puzzler%20at%20first%20glance%2C%20but%20could%20make%20sense%20if%20Samsung%20loops%20in%20its%20appliance%20business.%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3117493%2Fsamsung-home-automation-smartthings%2F","omniture":{"modules":"rr-taboola-video|rr-partner|rr-ad"}},{"url":"http:\/\/time.com\/3117526\/7-dead-as-battle-erupts-in-somali-capital\/","shortlink":"http:\/\/ti.me\/YdyEd2","title":"7 Dead as Battle Erupts in Somali Capital","post_type":"post","time_article":true,"comments_allowed":true,"short_title":"7 dead as battle erupts in Somali capital","format":"brief","time":{"pretty":"12:15 PM ET","published":"2014-08-15 12:15:07","updated":"2014-08-15 16:15:07","minute":"12:15 pm","short":"12:15 PM ET"},"authors":[{"id":193865,"url":"http:\/\/time.com\/author\/associated-press\/","name":"AP \/ Abdi Guled","bio":"","twitter":"","twitter_url":"","gplus":"","fb":"","email":"","thumbnail":null}],"content":"<aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-taboola-video\" data-name=\"rr-taboola-video\"><div id=\"taboola-right-rail-organic-video-3117526\" class=\"taboola\" data-mode=\"verticalx3\" data-placement=\"right-rail-organic\" data-type=\"video\"><\/div><\/aside><p>(MOGADISHU, Somalia) \u2014 Combat shook Mogadishu early Friday as government troops launched a dawn attack on a house belonging to a former warlord as part of a disarmament campaign. Seven people died in the violence.<\/p>\n<p>Explosions and gunfire were heard as troops battled militiamen loyal to the former warlord.<\/p>\n<p>The African Union military force in Somalia, AMISOM, said the raid was carried out near the home of a former district commissioner, Ahmed Daci. The AU said that Daci&#8217;s militia fired at AMISOM, precipitating a firefight.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;During the operation, the militia was overpowered and 20 were arrested, 15 guns and an assortment of ammunition recovered,&#8221; AMISOM said on its Twitter feed.<\/p>\n<p>In bloody scenes that recalled the days of daily warfare in this seaside city, wounded Somalis were carted off the hospitals and onlookers helped carry or push the casualties.<\/p>\n<p>The dead included four civilians, two militia members and one soldier, said police officer Capt. Mohammed Hussein. Eight people were wounded, he said.<\/p>\n<p>Launched last week, the Somali government&#8217;s disarmament campaign is an attempt to reduce the number of weapons in the violence-prone city. The government says some 500 guns were recovered during the first four operations. Friday&#8217;s operation was the fifth.<\/p>\n<p>The target of the government&#8217;s disarmament campaign is the feared and powerful clan warlords. The government says the raids are taking place to ensure that the city&#8217;s arms don&#8217;t fall in the hands of al-Shabab militants.<\/p>\n<p>However, some opposition politicians believe that the weapons drive is an attempt to silence or neutralize opponents of the government. A national election is scheduled for 2016 if the security situation permits.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We are ready to lay down weapons for the pacification of Mogadishu, but this kind of tactic will not work,&#8221; said Abdullahi Sheikh Hassan, a Somali politician whose home was also raided Friday.<\/p>\n<p>Fatima Ali, a Mogadishu mother of four, said Friday&#8217;s battle sent everyone in her house to the ground for safety.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We are very terrified,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We haven&#8217;t heard something like this for some time.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>A proposed disarmament law has been approved by the government&#8217;s cabinet but hasn&#8217;t yet been voted on by parliament.<\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3117526\"><\/div><\/aside>","section":{"name":"World","slug":"world","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/world\/"},"id":3117526,"encoded_url":"http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3117526%2F7-dead-as-battle-erupts-in-somali-capital%2F","encoded_shortlink":"http%3A%2F%2Fti.me%2FYdyEd2","encoded_title":"7+Dead+as+Battle+Erupts+in+Somali+Capital","twitter_text":"7%20Dead%20as%20Battle%20Erupts%20in%20Somali%20Capital","twitter_via":"TIMEWorld","Partner_Module":{"partner":"Select","post_title":"7 Dead as Battle Erupts in Somali Capital "},"email_title":"7%20Dead%20as%20Battle%20Erupts%20in%20Somali%20Capital%20%7C%20TIME","email_body":"7%20Dead%20as%20Battle%20Erupts%20in%20Somali%20Capital%0A%0A%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3117526%2F7-dead-as-battle-erupts-in-somali-capital%2F","omniture":{"modules":"rr-taboola-video|rr-ad"}},{"url":"http:\/\/time.com\/3117444\/best-organization-apps\/","shortlink":"http:\/\/ti.me\/1t6ERC5","title":"Here Are Some Apps to Keep Your Family Organized","post_type":"post","time_article":true,"comments_allowed":true,"short_title":"Here Are Some Apps to Keep Your Family Organized","format":"article","time":{"pretty":"12:14 PM ET","published":"2014-08-15 12:14:38","updated":"2014-08-15 16:14:38","minute":"12:14 pm","short":"12:14 PM ET"},"authors":[{"id":207602854,"url":"http:\/\/time.com\/author\/techlicious\/","name":"Techlicious \/ Suzanne Kantra","bio":"","twitter":"techlicious","twitter_url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/techlicious","gplus":"","fb":"","email":"","thumbnail":null}],"content":"<p>Appointments, medications, game schedules, chores \u2014 to make a household run smoothly, you need a safe place to store and share information.

A second group of mice were given continuous low-dose penicillin after they were weaned from their mother, as well as through the rest of their lives. A final group of mice were received no penicillin. Their finding: The mice given the antibiotics got fat.<\/p>\n<p>In a final experiment, the researchers transferred microbiota from the mice exposed to antibiotics to mice who hadn&#8217;t been exposed, and found that the mice who got the microbiota from the antibiotic-treated donors also got fatter, showing the bacteria was enough to create a change in body composition.<\/p>\n<p>The new findings support the researchers&#8217; early work published in 2012 in <em>Nature<\/em>, which showed that mice exposed to low doses of antibiotics throughout their lives generally has 10 to 15% more body fat.<\/p>\n<p>There are a few things to keep in mind with the new findings, the first being that the study was in mice and not humans, and humans do not receive a continuous supply of antibiotics. Still, the researchers think these results may have implications for kids. &#8220;For children, we think there is an implication that early-in-life antibiotics could have some costs that were previously unknown,&#8221; says Blaser. &#8220;It is further stimulus for more judicious use of antibiotics in children.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Some of the most common uses of antibiotics in childhood are for treating upper respiratory [illness] and ear infections,&#8221; says Blaser. &#8220;We already know that [many] of them are caused by viruses that antibiotics don&#8217;t even work for. And yet many children are being treated by antibiotics for these mild ear infections. So as evidence accumulates &#8230; doctors and patients and parents may say, OK, let&#8217;s wait a few days and see how this ear infection is going to go. Most of the time it gets better by itself.&#8221; Blaser says if a child is really sick, they should take antibiotics.<\/p>\n<p>Research into the effects of the over use of antibiotics is a continuing body of study, and something both Blaser&#8217;s team and other research groups are still trying to understand.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div

(They also cost a lot to produce: $180 million for the pair.) Then there&#8217;s the Hollywood affirmative-action program of hiring marquee studs from three or more decades ago. Having a star \u2014 or his overworked stunt double \u2014 beat the crap out of the hundreds of interchangeable Slavs who served as camera fodder in the big set pieces of this movie, shot in Bulgaria, is probably more rewarding for an old-time action hero than a workout with his personal trainer. The stars get paid, and the audience pays to watch them. Up to their familiar geriat-tricks, the Over the Hill Gang rides again and again.<\/p>\n<aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-mag\" data-name=\"rr-mag\"><div class=\"read-more-inline magazine has-cover\"><h6 class=\"read-more-list-h read-more-popular\">Popular Among Subscribers<\/h6>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"popular-lead\"><a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3110842\/robin-williams-the-heart-of-comedy\/?pcd=pw-pas\"><img title=\"\" alt=\"Eat Butter Fat Time Magazine Cover\" src=\"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/06\/fat-cover.jpg?w=560\" data-loaded=\"true\"><\/a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3110842\/robin-williams-the-heart-of-comedy\/?pcd=pw-pas\" class=\"read-more-article\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"read-more-inline-title time-icons time-icons-key\">Robin Williams: The Heart of Comedy<\/h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/subscription.time.com\/storefront\/subscribe-to-time\/link\/1019509.html\" class=\"subscribe-button\">Subscribe<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div><a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3110832\/what-comes-after-ebola\/?pcd=pw-pas\" class=\"read-more-article\" format-video><h3 class=\"read-more-inline-title time-icons time-icons-key\">What Comes After Ebola<\/h3><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3062889\/manopause-aging-insecurity-and-the-2-billion-testosterone-industry\/?pcd=pw-pas\" class=\"read-more-article\" format-article><h3 class=\"read-more-inline-title time-icons time-icons-key\">Manopause?!

The top-billed kids in the cast are Jason Statham, 45, and Terry Crews, 46. Bruce Willis, Jean-Claude Van Damme and Chuck Norris sat this one out, and Steven Seagal has yet to be conscripted. But there are dozens of grizzled macho men available for disposable movies like this<em> Expendables<\/em> (which was directed by Patrick Hughes). The pity is that one can&#8217;t even imagine a similar action-film showcase for a dozen or so actresses over 50. Lord preserve us from <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3086763\/expendabelles-cast-expendables-spinoff\/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Expendabelles<\/em><\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>(READ: Lily Rothman on <a title=\"Summer males\" href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/46909\/summer-movies-2014-bechdel-test-female-characters\/\" target=\"_blank\">Why the big summer movies have male stars<\/a>)<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In the script by Stallone and the writing duo of Creighton Rothenberger and Katrin Benedikt (who brought marginally more coherence to last year&#8217;s <em>Olympus Has Fallen<\/em>), Ford&#8217;s Agent Drummer of the CIA hands Barney a black-ops mission to capture Stonebanks, an art collector who&#8217;s peddling thermobaric weapons to every African dictator and Middle Eastern terror group. Turns out Stonebanks and Barney formed the original Expendables team way back when, but broke up over an issue of ethics: Barney had &#8216;em, Stonebanks didn&#8217;t. This strikes a clangorous chord in anyone who actually remembers the first film, in which Barney proclaimed, \u201cIf the money\u2019s good, we don\u2019t care what the job is.\u201d This time, he doesn&#8217;t care what the money is. If Stonebanks is financing groups like ISIS, then the CIA must be good.<\/p>\n<p><strong>(READ: Aryn Baker on <a title=\"5 things about ISIS\" href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/2864407\/iraq-isis-baghdad-tikrit-al-qaeda\/\" target=\"_blank\">Five Things to Know about ISIS<\/a>)<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Believing that this assignment, or the one after that, may kill off his cohorts, Barney disbands the bunch. In the film&#8217;s interminable middle section he recruits a younger team of Expendables, who have unproved skills but apparently won&#8217;t mind dying in their thirties. This younger crowd (including MMA bantamweight champ Ronda Rousey as the token hot blond) has zero charisma. The only modest diversion is the belated appearance of Banderas as a desperately chatty jack of all dark trades. He stops babbling just when the gunfire begins in the long but thrill-deficient final assault on Stonebanks&#8217;s redoubt.<\/p>\n<p>If you and <em>The Expendables 3<\/em> are ever on a plane together, you could watch the first 20 minutes or so, depicting a helicopter and train attack on a prison that for eight years has held Snipes&#8217; Doc in solitary confinement. The <em>Blade<\/em> star, out of big movies for a decade because of money disputes with the U.S. Treasury, easily and artfully dominates every moment he&#8217;s on screen. Snipes also alludes to his troubles when Doc is asked why he got locked away and replies, &#8220;Tax evasion.&#8221; Alas, this self-reflexive humor doesn&#8217;t extend to Schwarzenegger \u2014 no housekeeper jokes \u2014 or to Gibson, who is spared an anti-Jewish rant scene. The closest Mel comes to autocritique is the threat, to the younger Expendables, &#8220;You should see me when I&#8217;m angry.&#8221; Thanks, Mel \u2014 we&#8217;ve <a title=\"TMZ Mel Gibson rant\" href=\"http:\/\/www.tmz.com\/2006\/07\/28\/exclusive-mel-gibson-busted-for-dui\/\" target=\"_blank\">seen it on TMZ<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>On that flight where you&#8217;re trapped with <em>Expendables 3<\/em>, check back in early in the second hour, when Stonebanks is held trussed and captive by Stallone. Gibson invests a soft-spoken, bitter logic in explaining the mercenary life; it&#8217;s a reminder of the actor&#8217;s quiet power, and, except for Snipes&#8217;s, the only scene likely to make viewers forget they&#8217;re sitting through a movie and, for a change, participate in it. You might also want to watch the climactic heavyweight fight between Gibson and Stallone. It could be <em>Rocky VII<\/em>, or a meaty brawl in an Equinox locker room reserved for AARP members.<\/p>\n<p><strong>(READ: Corliss on <a title=\"Passion Christ review\" href=\"http:\/\/content.time.com\/time\/magazine\/article\/0,9171,593580,00.html\" target=\"_blank\">Mel Gibson&#8217;s <em>The Passion of the Christ<\/em><\/a>)<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Skip the ending, where, having assembled a two-generation Expendables entourage a dozen strong, Barney must say goodbye to each of them; it&#8217;s got more farewells at the end than <em>The Return of the King<\/em>. Frodo, you&#8217;ll recall, was leaving permanently for the Undying Lands. But the new movie&#8217;s prime mover has to hope he&#8217;s saying <em>au revoir<\/em>, not <em>adieu<\/em>, to his old and younger pals. In another two years Stallone \u2014 who will be 70 then, exactly twice as old as he was in 1979 \u2014 may gift us with an <em>Expendables 4<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>Look, Mick Jagger, Keith Richards and Bill Wyman are all in their seventies, and the Rolling Stones continue to proclaim the Age \u2014 the advanced age \u2014 of Rock. Why can&#8217;t Sly and the family Stallone think that 2016 could still be the Age of Rocky under another name?<\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3115798\"><\/div><\/aside>","section":{"name":"Entertainment","slug":"entertainment","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/entertainment\/"},"tag":{"name":"movies","slug":"movies","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/tag\/movies\/"},"tags":"Arnold Schwarzenegger|mel gibson|movies|Sylvester Stallone|the expendables 3|wesley snipes","hero":{"class":"wide","thumbnail":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/08\/expendables3.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1","src":{"small":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/08\/expendables3.jpg?w=280","small_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/08\/expendables3.jpg?w=560","large":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/08\/expendables3.jpg?w=840","large_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/08\/expendables3.jpg?w=1680"},"credit":"Phil Bray","caption":"","alt":"BRAY_20130830_EXP3_6082.dng"},"id":3115798,"encoded_url":"http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3115798%2Fthe-expendables-3-review%2F","encoded_shortlink":"http%3A%2F%2Fti.me%2F1uA8ajr","encoded_title":"REVIEW%3A+Stallone+Reassembles+the+Old%2C+Old+Gang+for+The+Expendables+3","twitter_text":"REVIEW%3A%20Stallone%20Reassembles%20the%20Old%2C%20Old%20Gang%20for%20The%20Expendables%203","twitter_via":"TIMECulture","Partner_Module":{"partner":"Select","post_title":"REVIEW: Stallone Reassembles the Old, Old Gang for <i>The Expendables 3<\/i>"},"email_title":"REVIEW%3A%20Stallone%20Reassembles%20the%20Old%2C%20Old%20Gang%20for%20The%20Expendables%203%20%7C%20TIME","email_body":"REVIEW%3A%20Stallone%20Reassembles%20the%20Old%2C%20Old%20Gang%20for%20The%20Expendables%203%0A%0ASly%20hopes%20third%20time%27s%20the%20charm%20for%20his%20mercenaries%20on%20a%20mission%2C%20but%20the%20only%20standouts%20are%20those%20two%20outlaw%20stars%2C%20Mel%20Gibson%20and%20Wesley%20Snipes%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3115798%2Fthe-expendables-3-review%2F","omniture":{"modules":"rr-taboola-video|rr-partner|rr-mag|rr-ad"}},{"url":"http:\/\/time.com\/3117359\/taylor-swift-seth-meyers-work-out\/","shortlink":"http:\/\/ti.me\/1oADpbK","title":"Why Taylor Swift Looks So Perfect Post-Workout","post_type":"post","time_article":true,"comments_allowed":true,"short_title":"Why Taylor Swift Looks So Perfect Post-Workout","excerpt":"Seth Meyers: \"I picture you in the locker room taking up a lot of space.\"","format":"article","time":{"pretty":"11:53 AM ET","published":"2014-08-15 11:53:39","updated":"2014-08-15 15:53:39","minute":"11:53 am","short":"11:53 AM ET"},"authors":[{"id":206962657,"url":"http:\/\/time.com\/author\/eliana-dockterman\/","name":"Eliana Dockterman","bio":"Eliana Dockterman is a living, culture and breaking news reporter for TIME in New York City.","twitter":"edockterman","twitter_url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/edockterman","gplus":"113363882407325344789","fb":"","email":"","thumbnail":"http:\/\/i0.wp.com\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/03\/mg_3663.jpg?crop=278px%2C150px%2C2497px%2C2497px&resize=100%2C100"}],"content":"<p>Last night, T-Swift tried to explain to Seth Meyers how she looks so darn good after she exercises.<\/p>\n<p>The <em>Late Night<\/em> host presented the pop star with several paparazzi pictures of her exiting her gym (like the one on the right) in which Swift&#8217;s hair looks perfectly coiffed, her clothes immaculately pressed, her iconic red lipstick on her lips.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I picture you in the locker room taking up a lot of space,&#8221; Meyers joked.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I like to bring a change of clothes,&#8221; Swift said defensively. &#8220;I bring a hairbrush with me.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Swift is clearly doing a bit more than running a brush through her hair.
