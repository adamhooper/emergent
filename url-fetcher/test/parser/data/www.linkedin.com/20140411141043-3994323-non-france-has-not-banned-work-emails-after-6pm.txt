Reading headlines in the English-speaking press yesterday, it seemed that France’s latest measure to protect its "lazy, striking" workers was to ban them from checking emails after 6pm. Sadly it’s not quite true, and today their Gallic counterparts have tried to put the record straight.

Headlines included "French win right to switch off at home”, “When the French clock off at 6pm they really mean it” and “No emails after 6pm please, we are French” with many commentators apparently taking their cues from the Guardian article.

Just in case you weren't jealous enough of the French already, what with their effortless style, lovely accents and collective will to calorie control, they have now just made it illegal to work after 6pm. Well, sort of,” read the Guardian.

The article was quickly devoured without further fact-checking by media sites from the US to Australia.

Amazement on social media

Anglo social media channels were full of comments and amazement at the thought of their work-shy French counterparts switching off phones, laptops and tablets across the country at 6, to protect their right not to work a single minute more than their jealously protected 35 hours a week.

Once the smartphones were off, French workers, dressed in Breton jerseys, with onions and garlic strung around their necks, would light a Gauloise, head to the nearest brasserie to gorge on foie gras, share a bottle of Beaujolais Villages, and spend the evening exchanging Gallic shrugs at the state of their country’s economy.

Correction in French

But as the web site Slate.fr (Site in French) pointed out on today, there were serious inaccuracies in the English-speaking press’s coverage of the “disconnection agreement”.

“France has not banned workers from sending emails after 6pm” was the simple headline in Slate, pointing out that the agreement, which is not a new law, between federations Syntec and Cinov and the unions CFDT and CGC, only affects around 200,000 people, not the whole of France as some of the headlines would have us believe, or even the “million workers” quoted in the Guardian.

The workers affected are mainly employed in management positions and work outside the framework of a 35-hour week. In fact they work all hours of the day and evening, hence the need for them to be protected.

Slate also points out that the agreement has absolutely no mention of a 6pm cut-off point, in fact there is no ban on workers checking emails after a certain time, just that they should step away from their work email for 11 hours a day.

The reality of the agreement

The reality, as union leader Michel de la Force explains, is that the agreement simply means: “That an employee who does not open his emails on his time off, cannot be criticised.”

Asked to comment about his perceived understanding of the facts after seeing the Anglo press coverage yesterday evening (9:05pm UK time, in case you're curious), reputation management expert Andy Beal said on Twitter "I’m against regulations for private businesses. The decision should be left to the employer & employee. We live in a global economy now. Remember what happen to BA (sponsored tweet by angry customer) because it was after hours?"

Andy added "I wouldn't worry about them being able to enforce it, it seems like our government has a hard enough time rolling out a website, let alone tracking my business vs personal calls. ;-)"

What do you think? Do you check company emails in the evenings - and does your employer expect you to do so, and respond in that timeframe?
