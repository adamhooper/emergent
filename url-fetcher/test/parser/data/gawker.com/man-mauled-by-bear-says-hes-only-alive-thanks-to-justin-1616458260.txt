A Russian fisherman says the only thing that prevented a brown bear from killing him was Justin Bieberâ€”specifically, a ringtone of Bieber's first big hit, "Baby."

Igor Vorozhbitsyn, 42, had parked his car and started walking toward the fishing spot he'd marked out for that day when the bear jumped him from behind.

"There was a tremendous impact on my back and the bear was on top of me," he said, according to the Daily Mail.

The bear mauled Vorozhbitsyn's face and chest, inflicting serious cuts and bruises. He believes it probably would have killed him if his phone hadn't gone off in the nick of time, blaring "Baby" loudly enough to drive the bear away.

After narrowly escaping death, he also escaped a lifetime of being known as a Belieber.

"I know that sort of ringtone isn't to everyone's taste but my granddaughter loaded it onto my phone for a joke," the fisherman said.

The Mail quotes a bear expert as saying there wasn't anything about Bieber's music in particular that bears find offensive, but "sometimes a sharp shock can stop an angry bear in its tracks, and that ringtone would be a very unexpected sound for a bear."

"What's up, bitch?" Bieber said, albeit earlier and in a completely non-bear-related context.
