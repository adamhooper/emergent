Correction: A bird did not defecate on Russian President Vladimir Putin during a speech on Friday. The video appears to have been a hoax. In this version, the headline and the post have been corrected.

Vladimir Putin spoke at the dedication of a new monument to the First World War in Moscow on Friday. The Russian president said that the lessons of the war, which began a century ago this summer, were that peace is fragile, that military aggression is dangerous and that violence can generate more violence in turn.

Putin has supported the separatists in Ukraine who apparently shot down a Malaysian airliner last month, killing all 298 people on board. In the video above, a bird appears to defecate on Vladimir Putin, but it appears that the footage was altered.

European countries have been observing the centenary of the war this weekend, which claimed some 16 million lives, both soldiers and civilians.
