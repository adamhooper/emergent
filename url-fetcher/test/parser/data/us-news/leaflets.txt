An unverified leaflet is causing a stir in and around Ukraine, calling for Jews in the Donetsk region to register themselves or face deportation or loss of citizenship.

The leaflets claim to be distributed by the Donetsk People’s Republic, a self-declared political group under the leadership of Denis Pushilin. He denies that the signature on the leaflets is his, or that his group has had any involvement in producing them.

CNN reports it is yet unclear who distributed the fliers or whether any group will enforce the troubling claims.

"All citizens of Jewish nationality over age of 16, living on territories of Donetsk People's Republic, have to register with DPR commissioner of nationality before May 3rd, 2014 at the Donetsk Regional Administration, room 514, registration fee is $50," the leaflets say, according to CNN’s translation. "Must have in person $50 cash, passport, all available IDs, and documentation of ownership of real estate and transportation."

Secretary of State John Kerry said the leaflets are “grotesque” and “beyond unacceptable,” while speaking at a news conference in Geneva following four-party peace talks.

Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla., who served as the House Foreign Affairs Committee chairwoman until last year, called the leaflets a "disgusting and despicable scheme," and said in a statement it still remains unclear who is behind it and what they hope to achieve.

"This rhetoric is emblematic of a rising trend of anti-Semitism around the world," she added. "All parties in Ukraine should immediately and unequivocally condemn this act and work to uncover who is behind such vile and blind hatred. This appears to be a politically motivated attempt to foment fear and further stoke the unrest in an already volatile situation in Ukraine."

U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Geoffrey Pryatt told CNN he had seen a copy of a leaflet, shown to him by a Jewish leader there.

Members of the Jewish community in Donetsk say the distribution of the flyers “smells like provocation,” CNN reports.

Reports of the fliers was first distributed by Israel’s Ynet News. It expands on the demands within the leaflets, including that Jews must register all of their family members and have documentation of all of their major assets.

"Evasion of registration will result in citizenship revoke and you will be forced outside the country with a confiscation of property,” Ynet reports of the leaflets.

Alex Tenzer, a Kiev native and one of the directors of the National Association of Immigrants from the Former USSR in Israel, told YNet the fliers remind him of materials distributed by the Nazi Party during World War II.

"The Jewish-Ukrainian leadership supports Ukraine's new government, but it's hard to tell whether the leaflet is valid or simply a provocation,” he told YNet.
