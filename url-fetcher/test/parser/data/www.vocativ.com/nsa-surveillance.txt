Call it the Edward Snowden effect.

In the year since the former National Security Agency contractor leaked a series of classified documents about the NSA’s online surveillance programs, many in this privacy-obsessed nation have continued to worry about American snooping.

Now a growing number of Germans are reportedly seeking a low-tech solution: typewriters.

“We are currently experiencing a real run on the machines,” Rolf Bonnen, a manager at the typewriter manufacturer Bandermann, told the German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine.

Among the new customers: the German government. When a television interviewer recently asked Patrick Sensburg, the head of Germany’s parliamentary investigation into the NSA, about whether his group was considering switching to typewriters, he replied: “As a matter of fact, we have—and not electronic models, either.”

Germans are particularly sensitive to government snooping in part because of the inglorious history of Nazi intelligence and the East German secret police. It didn’t help that the NSA was spying on German Chancellor Angela Merkel, or that news broke earlier this month that the Americans had a German double agent working for them in Berlin.

In the meantime, typewriter companies aren’t the only firms to benefit from what Foreign Affairs calls “Snowdenfreude.” A few tech companies have actually seen sales rise, including Silent Circle, based in Washington, D.C. Earlier this year, it released the Blackphone, a cellphone equipped with special encryption technology, which the firm says has done well in Germany.

“We even say it ourselves: The best way to make your phone secure is to go throw it in the river,” says Vic Hyder, Silent Circle’s chief revenue officer. “Carrying these phones around opens you up to the world. We are trying to make phones that make you as private and secure as you can be while still functioning in our world.”

For the most part, however, the NSA scandal seems to have been bad for American tech and telecom companies in Germany, where the surveillance scandal could lead to $180 billion in losses by 2016. Tech companies are definitely taking notice. In June, for instance, the German government canceled a major German government contract with Verizon.

Still, not everyone thinks the move to analog is a good idea. As one German politician told Spiegel Online: “The idea that we can protect people from surveillance by dragging them back to the typewriter is absurd.”
