Biebs may not be able to take Orlando Bloom in a bare knuckle fight but a grizzly bear poses no such problem to the pint sized pugilist

Orlando Bloom may be glad to know he is not the only one who can’t stomach Justin Bieber.

The Lord of the Rings star’s latest ally in his fallout with the pop loudmouth is a wild Russian Bear - who found the singer truly unbearable.

The beast had pounced on fisherman Igor Vorozhbitsyn and would have certainly have killed him .... until Igor’s phone went off and played Bieber’s hit Baby. So grisly did the mighty grizzly find the ringtone tune that it turned tail and fled back into the forest.

Recounting his terrifying experience in northern Russia’s Yakutia Republic, badly mauled Igor said: “I was walking to my fishing spot when there was a tremendous impact on my back and the bear was on top of me. I couldn’t believe my luck when the phone went off and he fled. My granddaughter had loaded the ringtone onto my phone for a joke.”

Wildlife experts believe it must have startled the bear into halting its attack. “That ringtone would be a very unexpected sound for a bear,” said one.

Perhaps lifesaver Bieber should now dub himself Lord of the Ringtones.
