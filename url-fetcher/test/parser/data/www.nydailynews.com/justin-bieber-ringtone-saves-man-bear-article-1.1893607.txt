Igor Vorozhbitsyn was going fishing in Yakutia Republic when the bear began to maul him. But Bieber’s ‘Baby’ had been installed as a ringtone on his phone — and caused the bear to stop and flee after he got a call.

Justin Bieber saved a Russian fisherman from the clutches of a killer bear.

The deadly beast bolted after hearing the pop brat's smash hit "Baby" blasting out of Igor Vorozhbitsyn's cellphone.

The 42-year-old was walking to his favorite angling spot in the Yakutia Republic when the animal pounced.

As it clawed his face, the rodman feared he was about to be killed.

But then his cell phone started to ring and the Bieber tone installed by his granddaughter startled his attacker, who fled back into the forest.

Vorozhbitsyn, who suffered deep cuts and bruises to his face and chest, then used his cell to call for help.

"I couldn't believe my luck when the phone went off and he fled," he told the Croatian Times.

"I know that sort of ringtone isn't to everyone's taste but my granddaughter loaded it onto my phone for a joke," he added.
