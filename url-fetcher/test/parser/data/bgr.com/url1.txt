Rarely does Apple permit its employees to pull back the curtain and tell the world the inside story of how a product came to be, but that’s exactly what happened when one Apple engineer gave an exclusive interview about the sleek new Retina MacBook on Spanish TV.

Ok, that’s not true at all, but it’s the premise of a hilarious new viral video that will have Apple fans dying of laughter.

YouTuber and gadget reviewer Armando Ferreira posted an amazing parody video on YouTube on Wednesday and it has since gone viral among Apple fans and tech enthusiasts in general. The video shows an amazing Spanish-language interview about… something, but the subtitles have been replaced so that they tell the gut-busting behind-the-scenes story of how Apple’s new Retina MacBook came to be.

The resulting video is, in a word, amazing.

The full video is embedded below, and make sure you turn the volume up. Way up.
