MARK COLVIN: The organisers of the huge AIDS 2014 conference that's about to get underway in Melbourne fear that as many as a hundred of their delegates may have been on MH-17.

The renowned Dutch AIDS researcher Professor Joep Lange is believed to be among them. 

Their colleagues say the best tribute is getting on with the conference and AIDS research.

Samantha Donovan reports.

SAMANTHA DONOVAN: Melbourne has been readying itself this week for the arrival of 12,000 delegates to the AIDS 2014 International Conference. 

But now organisers are waiting with dread to hear how many were killed on MH-17.

The Victorian Premier Denis Napthine says the toll is unclear. 

DENIS NAPTHINE: It may be up to 100. This is a large conference. Tragically there are some very, very significant people who've done a great lot in their lifetime in terms of AIDS research, promotion of dealing with HIV AIDS, both in their own countries and across the world, who have lost their lives in this unspeakable tragedy. 

SAMANTHA DONOVAN: Nobel Prize winning AIDS researcher, Professor Francoise Barre-Sinoussi, addressed the National Press Club in Canberra today.

FRANCOISE BARRE-SINOUSSI: It's a very sad day and I apologise if I don't feel so well. As you said, in that plane probably it was many passengers coming to the AIDS conference in Melbourne, including friends, colleagues, and our thoughts right now are really with them, with their family.

SAMANTHA DONOVAN: One of the renowned researchers feared lost is Dutchman, Professor Joep Lange, a former president of the International AIDS Society.

Professor Barre-Sinoussi said she'd been privileged to work with him.

FRANCOISE BARRE-SINOUSSI: Joep was a wonderful person, a great professional, but more than that, a wonderful human being. So if it is confirmed, it will be a terrible loss for all of us.

SAMANTHA DONOVAN: Francoise Barre-Sinoussi says the best tribute to lost colleagues is to move on with the conference and the work.

FRANCOISE BARRE-SINOUSSI: We have to continue and we have also to have new generation of health professional to move in this period of those who will not be there anymore. It's our duty for us, that are still there, to try really to have a new generation of Joep and others because that is, again, the best tribute I think we can give to them.

SAMANTHA DONOVAN: The families and friends of the Australians killed are also grieving.

Perth man Nick Norris was travelling home from Amsterdam with his three grandchildren.

His 24-year-old son Brack Norris spoke to Triple J's Hack program.

BRACK NORRIS: I got woken up by my sister at above 5.30 in the morning, she was in Sydney so she was a couple of hours ahead and yeah, basically opened with the lines, Dad's plane has been shot down, which I just thought she was kidding, but yeah, clearly not.

SAMANTHA DONOVAN: Brack Norris says his father Nick was a fantastic man who'd worked as a business consultant focusing on Aboriginal education in remote communities.

BRACK NORRIS: Really supportive of all his family, had lots of friends. We all loved him a great deal and we're going to miss him terribly.

SAMANTHA DONOVAN: Brack Norris says his sister and brother-in-law had decided to stay on in Amsterdam for a few days. They've now lost their three children.

BRACK NORRIS: They were my sister's children and there were three of them and he was just basically bringing them back from a family holiday to start school off next week. They were eight, 10 and 12.
