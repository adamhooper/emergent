The president of the International AIDS Society says the shooting down of flight MH17 has cost the world a giant in the field of HIV/AIDS research.

It is understood six of the 298 people killed on the downed Malaysia Airlines jet were heading to the AIDS 2014 conference in Melbourne, including researchers, health workers, activists and people living with HIV.

IAS president and Nobel laureate Francoise Barre-Sinousi has told the National Press Club in Canberra the loss of life is difficult to comprehend.

"We are all with our phones waiting for confirmation and hoping that it cannot be confirmed," she said.

Next of kin are still being informed, but Dutch HIV researcher and former IAS president Dr Joep Lange and his wife and collaborator Jacqueline van Tongeren are among those killed.

"It will be a great loss for the HIV/AIDS community," Professor Barré-Sinousi said.

"It will be a terrible loss for all of us. I have no words really to try to express my sadness. I feel totally devastated if it is confirmed.

"This is really someone special. It's a giant for us."

Professor Barré-Sinousi said she worked closely with her predecessor.

"He is the man with the spirit, I used to say the best spirit, which is really he has been trying forever for his life to give for the benefit of mankind.

"A great professional but more than that, a wonderful human being."

Dr Lange was a clinical researcher who had been working on HIV since the early years of the virus, participating in clinical trials and training in developing countries.

In 2000, he founded the not-for-profit organisation PharmAccess Foundation to improve access to HIV/AIDS therapy in places like sub-Saharan Africa and Asia.

The co-chair for AIDS 2014 and director of the Infectious Disease Unit at Alfred Hospital, Professor Sharon Lewin, says Dr Lange was passionate about his work.

"He was quite visionary, I think, since the very early days of the epidemic and could see what the challenges were that lay ahead," Professor Lewin said.

"I guess personally, I found him to be a real renaissance man. He was really interested in so much in the world, in books and arts and literature."

'Best tribute' would be to continue with conference

The 20th International AIDS Conference, which will go ahead as planned, is due begin on Sunday and run until July 25.

A number of high-profile people will attend the event, including former US president Bill Clinton and Sir Bob Geldof.

Professor Barré-Sinousi says there is no choice but to continue the conference.

"The decision to go on ... we are thinking about them, because we know that it's really what they would like us to do. It's how we take the decision."

She says it is too early to say if the lost HIV experts will be commemorated at the Melbourne conference, but that the best tribute will be to just go on.

"It's our duty for us that are still there to try really to have a new generation of Joep and others."

"It is ... the best tribute, I think, we can give to them."

The World Health Organisation has also confirmed that one of its staff, Glenn Thomas, was on the flight.

"We are shocked and devastated by the loss. Glenn was a very dear colleague, completely dedicated to his work and the cause , a lovely person so much appreciated by all of us," spokesman Gottfried Hirnschall said.
