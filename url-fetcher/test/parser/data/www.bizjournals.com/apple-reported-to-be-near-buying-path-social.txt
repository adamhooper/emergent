Path CEO and founder Dave Morin. Is Apple is close to a deal to buy the social networking company Path?

Apple is close to a deal to buy Path, the social networking company that bills itself as ideal for close friends and family, according to the news site Pando Daily, which cited a single unnamed member of Apple's engineering team.

The acquisition report buttressed speculation inspired by the fact that Path co-founder and CEO Dave Morin was in the front row at Apple's big product unveiling event Tuesday and posted a photograph of himself with Dr. Dre,. The rap star is co-founder of Beats by Dre, the headphones maker and music streaming business that Apple bought for $3 billion in August.

Morin declined to comment one way or another onstage at TechCrunch's Disrupt conference Wednesday.

Well known Internet entrepreneur Jason Calcanis, however, commented on Morin's presence in a newsletter he dispatched Tuesday evening saying a deal is plainly on the table.

"Dave Morin was chilling in the first row of the event two seats from Johnny Ive and — I think — next to Dr. Dre. That means one thing and one thing only: Path and the team are going to Apple. You don’t get that first row seat by accident," Calcanis wrote.

San Francisco-based Path was founded in 2010 and has raised about $67 million, including a $25 million round disclosed in January. Though featured repeatedly by Apple and lauded for its aesthetic sensibility, its app has struggled in the U.S. marketplace, and Morin acknowledged Tuesday that Path has "been through a lot of ups and downs."

He emphasized, however, Path has found significant success in Southeast Asia, particularly in Indonesia. The Path app now has 5 million daily active users globally, and a separate messaging app the company released in June called Path Talk has more than a million daily active users, he said.

"We've got a vibrant and very happy community," Morin said. 

Morin also expressed optimism for a new service it is developing that will enable users to message agents who will contact businesses for information and then message users with answers.

Such positive developments follow a tough 2013. That year, Path had layoffs in October and the Federal Trade Commission in February fined the company $800,000 for illegally collecting information about children without their parents consent. Also as part of that trade commission deal, Path settled an FTC complaint that it had downloaded personal information without permission, including contacts, from users' mobile phones.

The company stopped the both practices that were part of the FTC inquiry and apologized.
