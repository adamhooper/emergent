In a story straight out of a Russian folk tale, Igor Vorozhbitsyn was walking to his favorite fishing spot in Northern Russia when a bear leaped out of the woods and pinned him down, swiping and clawing at him. Mauled and bleeding, Vorozhbitsyn thought he was about to die.

And then Justin Bieber‘s “Baby” started playing on his phone.

“‘I couldn’t believe my luck when the phone went off and he fled,” Vorozhbitsyn said, according to the Daily Mail. “‘I know that sort of ringtone isn’t to everyone’s taste.” (Okay, this isn’t the most romantic Russian folk tale.)

According to bear experts, bears are easily scared away by sudden, loud noises, ideally made with air horns, yelling, or, apparently, the tinny screeches emitted by douchebag teenyboppers allegedly “singing.”

Vorozhbitsyn survived after he used his phone to call for help, and has made a full recovery. As to why a burly, 42-year-old Russian man has “Baby” as his ringtone: “My granddaughter loaded it onto my phone for a joke.” Uh huh.
