According to CNN’s Brian Stelter, the hackers that attacked Sony Pictures have sent the company a messaging praising its decision to pull The Interview as a “very wise decision.” The group, dubbing itself the Guardians of Peace, had threatened attacks on U.S. theaters if the movie was not pulled. According to reports Friday, the FBI has determined that North Korea was behind the hack. In the message, the hackers told Sony, “Now we want you never let the movie released, distributed or leaked in any form of, for instance, DVD or piracy.” It reportedly went on to demand that, “everything related to the movie, including its trailers, as well as its full version down from any website hosting them immediately.”
