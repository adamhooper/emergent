As many as 100 passengers on the doomed Malaysia Airlines flight that crashed Thursday in eastern Ukraine were headed to Australia for the International AIDS Conference.

Flight MH17 from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, which US officials believe was hit by a surface-to-air missile over Ukraine, killing all 298 people on board, was due to connect with another flight to Melbourne.

According to the Sydney Morning Herald, scores of the passengers were delegates for the 20th International AIDS Conference, which is due to begin on Sunday.

The most high-profile victim was former International AIDS Society president Joep Lange (pictured).

Conference to go ahead

Held every two years, the International AIDS Conference is a forum for campaigners to highlight developments in fighting the disease and discuss financing problems.

It was this year also expected to channel anger about laws in Africa that stigmatise homosexuality and in the former Soviet Union that punish intravenous drug users â€“ a crackdown now extended to Russian-annexed Crimea.

Barre-Sinoussi said the conference would go ahead despite the tragic news.

"The decision to go on, we were thinking about them because we know it's really what they would have liked us to do," she said.

Some 12,000 participants are due to take part, joined by former US president Bill Clinton and rock singer and poverty activist Bob Geldof.

'Benefit to mankind'

Barre-Sinoussi paid tribute to Dutchman and leading AIDS researcher Lange, who has been involved in HIV research and treatment since 1983, saying he had dedicated his life to "the benefit of mankind".

American academic and AIDS activist Gregg Gonsalves tweeted that "lots of AIDS researchers, activists, officials on downed Malaysia Airlines flight to Melbourne for Intl AIDS Conference".

Of the 298 onboard the plane, 173 were Dutch nationals. There also were 44 Malaysians and 28 Australians, as well as passengers from Indonesia, Germany, Belgium, the Philippines, Britain and Canada.

The flight took off from Schiphol airport in Amsterdam and was supposed to land in Kuala Lumpur early Friday. A scheduled connection to Melbourne was due to arrive Friday evening.

Some 35 million people live with HIV although global AIDS-related deaths and new infections have fallen by more than a third in a decade, raising hopes of beating the killer disease by 2030, the United Nations said Wednesday.
