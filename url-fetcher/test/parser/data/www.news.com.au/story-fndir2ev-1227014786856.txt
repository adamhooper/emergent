A MAN was saved from a vicious bear attack thanks to his Justin Bieber ringtone.

Russian man Igor Vorozhbitsyn, 41, was walking to his favourite fishing spot when a brown bear attacked him.

As the bear clawed him, Mr Vorozhbitsyn’ mobile phone went off, setting off his ringtone, Justin Beiber’s ‘Baby’, reports The Austrian Times.

At the sound of the hit Beiber track, the bear turned and fled back into the forest.

“I had parked my car and was walking towards the spot I’d marked out when there was a tremendous impact on my back and the bear was on top of me.”

“I couldn’t believe my luck when the phone went off and he fled.”

“I know that sort of ringtone isn’t to everyone’s taste but my granddaughter loaded it onto my phone for a joke,” he said.

Wildlife experts said a sudden noise can frighten animals, even in mid-attack.

“Sometimes a sharp shock can stop an angry bear in its tracks and that ringtone would be a very unexpected sound for a bear,” a wildlife experts told The Austrian Times.

After the animal fled Mr Vorozhbitsyn used his phone to call for help.

He suffered cuts and bruises from the attack and is now recovering.
