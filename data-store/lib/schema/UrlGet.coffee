# An HTTP response from a GET of the give URL.

# Every Url has a number of UrlGet objects: one per GET request of that URL.
# (Truthmaker will poll with a GET request every once in a while to monitor
# articles for changes.)
#
# These are immutable. They're pretty big, too. Postgres will compress the body
# (it'll be a TOAST column), but even compressed, some URLs will take 20kb a
# pop.
