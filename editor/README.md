# Architecture

The *API* is an Express server. It responds to AJAX requests. Code is
in `api/`, tests are in `test/`. This code must work with NodeJS.

The *frontend* is a Backbone.Marionette client-side application. It
renders everything. Code is in `assets/js`, assets are in `test-js/`.
This code must work across supported web browsers.

In between, Express serves up files from `views/` and `dist/public`.
Gulp generates the files in `dist/public`.

We prefer CoffeeScript, but plain JavaScript shouldn't break anything.

# Testing

`mocha --watch` to run API tests and re-run when files change
`karma start` to run front-end tests and re-run when files change

# Developing

In one terminal, run `gulp`. This will recompile the assets as they change.

In another terminal, run `supervisor index.coffee`. This will run the Express
server and restart it when any files change.

Browse to http://localhost:1337 to see the result.

You may (nay, *should*) run Mocha, Karma and Express simultaneously when
developing.

# Deploying

Run `gulp prod` to compile assets.

Run `npm start`. This will run the server.
